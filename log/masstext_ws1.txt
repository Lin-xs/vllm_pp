Prompt: 'What is considered a high blood pressure reading?\n' 
Generated text: "It should be under 160/100.  I'm surprised you've never been tested.  It's normal for a doctor to do this when you're young and healthy.  But if you have a family history or are above a certain age, it is suggested you get it tested more often."

Prompt: 'What are the risks of having high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe risk of heart disease is 2 to 6 times greater if you have high blood pressure, compared to people with normal blood pressure.\n\nHigh blood pressure is usually caused by an imbalance in the amount of salt in the blood (sodium). When the kidneys excrete salt, some of it stays in the body to act as a buffer against the loss of sodium and fluids (water) from the body. If this buffer is depleted, it can cause high blood pressure.\n\nWhat causes high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure is the result of a build up of pressure in the arteries and veins. This is caused by a number of factors. These include:\n\nFamily history\n\nAged 65 years and over\n\nObesity\n\nFasting glucose\n\nSmoking\n\nAlcohol consumption\n\nCardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality, especially in older people.

You may need to stand up, sit down, or use a stethoscope.\n\nThe following are the various methods that can be used to assess the blood pressure reading:\n\nAmmeter – A device that measures the force of the blood flowing through the artery. The force of the blood depends on the elasticity of the artery wall, the elasticity of the blood itself, and the pressure on the artery. A small gauge (smaller than 5mm) is used to measure the blood pressure.\n\nAutomated monitor – A device that measures the blood pressure at several points in the arm, over a period of time.\n\nTracking blood pressure – An electronic device that measures the blood pressure throughout the day.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for high blood pressure?\n\nAchieving and maintaining a healthy blood pressure is important for your overall health. The following are the treatment options for high blood pressure:\n\nMedication\n\nMild to moderate high blood pressure can be treated with lifestyle changes, such as:\n\nExercise regularly\n\nEat a healthy diet\n\nReduce salt intake\n\nControl blood sugar levels\n\nTo reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, you should also be checked for:\n\nDiet and weight\n\nSmoking\n\nDiabetes\n\nHigh blood pressure can be treated with medication.\n\nMedication is usually started at a moderate dosage, and is gradually increased, until it is at the desired blood pressure level.\n\nOver the longer term, the following medication is usually prescribed:\n\nBlood pressure medication\n\nHigh blood pressure medication should be prescribed by a doctor or nurse. The doctor or nurse will advise the appropriate dose and schedule.\n\nHigh blood pressure medication may be taken by mouth, injected into a vein, or administered as a patch.\n\nIf your blood pressure is too high, it may be necessary to use a combination of medication.\n\nHow is high blood pressure managed?\n\nIf your doctor has prescribed medication for high blood pressure, it is important to take the medication regularly.\n\nYour doctor will also check your blood pressure regularly, and may prescribe other medicines, such as:\n\nTreatments for high blood pressure may be covered by Medicare.\n\nIf you have questions about your health, or have concerns about your health, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nHow can I best manage my blood pressure?\n\nThe following are some tips to help you manage your blood pressure:\n\nMaintain a healthy body weight\n\nMaintain a healthy body weight\n\nA healthy body weight is an important part of good health. It can be achieved by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.\n\nEat a healthy diet\n\nEat a healthy diet\n\nEating a healthy diet is an important part of maintaining good health.

Prompt: 'What kind of medicines can help control high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nSome common medicines to help control high blood pressure include diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, according to WebMD. Some of these drugs are combined with a diuretic in a pill called a diuretic-beta blocker combination pill, while others are combined with a calcium channel blocker in a pill called a calcium channel blocker-beta blocker combination pill.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nDiuretics reduce the amount of water in the body, causing it to lose sodium and become more concentrated, notes the Mayo Clinic. Beta-blockers reduce the heart rate, which allows the heart to work more efficiently and reduces the amount of oxygen the heart has to use. Calcium channel blockers help relax the blood vessels, allowing more blood to move through them, according to WebMD.'

Prompt: 'What is bronchiolitis and who is most susceptible to it?\n' 
Generated text: 'Bronchiolitis is a swelling of the airways in the lungs.\nThe condition is more common in children, but can occur in adults.\nExperts recommend that people with asthma make sure they\'re managing their condition well.\nBronchiolitis is an inflammation of the airways in the lungs. It is a common, but potentially serious condition which can cause shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing.\nThe i newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.\nWhat causes bronchiolitis?\n"Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the airways in the lungs and can be a result of infection, chemicals in the environment or breathing in an irritant," said Dr Saman Khamisa, consultant paediatric respiratory physician at the Royal London Hospital for Children, who was not involved in the study.\n"Children with bronchiolitis are more likely to have a virus than an infection of the lungs, and are more likely to have a virus that they get through contact with others rather than by breathing in something themselves."\nIn children, the main causes of bronchiolitis are viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza, Bordetella pertussis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nThe condition is more common in winter, and experts believe this is because many viruses thrive in cold weather.\nA new study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that there are more cases of bronchiolitis in winter than summer.\nMore than 2,500 children aged five to 11 were included in the study, and the researchers found that the number of cases peaked between November and February.\nDoctors say that the cause of bronchiolitis is not known and that there are no specific treatments.\nWhile there are no specific treatments for bronchiolitis, the condition is usually treated with rest and appropriate medication.\nHow common is bronchiolitis?\nAround two in every 100 children are diagnosed with bronchiolitis each year, but in some parts of the UK, the condition is more common.\nThe study found that in London, Wales and Scotland, there is a peak in bronchiolitis cases between November and February.\nIn England, there was a peak between December and February.\n"In winter, there are many more respiratory infections in children, but the peak in cases of bronchiolitis occurs in winter when there is a higher rate of viruses in the air," said Dr Khamisa.\nThe prevalence of bronchiolitis in children is highest in the five to nine age group, but the condition can occur in children of any age.\nBronchiolitis is more common in children than adults. The study found that the number of bronchiolitis cases peaked between November and February.\nWho is most susceptible to it?\nThe study found that the most common group of children who developed bronchiolitis were aged between two and five.\nAmong older children, the condition is rarer.\n"It\'s more common in children than adults, but adults are not immune to it either," said Dr Khamisa.\n"If someone has asthma, they need to make sure they\'re managing their condition well."\nIf you have asthma, you should have a regular check-up with your doctor.\nHow can you reduce the risk of bronchiolitis?\nDr Khamisa said that the best way to reduce the risk of bronchiolitis is to make sure you\'re managing your asthma well.\n"If you have asthma, it\'s important to get regular check-ups with your doctor to see how well you\'re managing your asthma," she said.\n"If you need your inhaler more often in winter, or you\'re having more episodes of wheezing or shortness of breath, talk to your GP about your asthma management plan."\nYou can also reduce the risk of bronchiolitis by staying well-hydrated, and by eating a healthy, balanced diet.'

Prompt: 'What are the signs of bronchiolitis in children and when should I seek medical attention?\n' 
Generated text: '\nBronchiolitis is a very common respiratory tract infection in children. The majority of children will recover without treatment in 2 to 3 days. The infection may be mild or severe.

Prompt: 'Hi, I have been experiencing joint pain lately. Can steroids help me with the pain?\n' 
Generated text: "\nHi, I have been experiencing joint pain lately. Can steroids help me with the pain?\n\nThis will be a common question that comes up in the forum. The answer is in general yes. The primary question is: what is your medical condition? Secondly, what is your medical history?\n\nThe steroid injection can help with joint pain. But the physician will have to ask a few questions about your medical history and your joint pain condition in order to give you the right medication.\n\nThe doctor will probably have to decide whether to give you the steroid injection in your shoulder. This will depend on the type of joint pain you have. The steroid will help reduce the inflammation in the joint. In some cases, the joint may be torn. In this case, the doctor will have to make an incision and repair the tear. If this is the case, then you will have to follow the doctor's instructions and you will be given the medication.\n\nIn this instance, the doctor will have to give you the medication on a daily basis. The doctor will give you the medication in your usual way. The doctor will probably advise you to take the medication before you go to bed. In most cases, the doctor will prescribe you the medication in a liquid form.\n\nThe doctor will usually prescribe you a steroid injection in the form of a long-acting injection. This is because in many cases, the injection is given in the shoulder. You will have to take the medication for a period of 2-3 months. The medication will help reduce the inflammation in your shoulder. It will also help you return to a normal function.\n\nIn order to ensure that you do not have side effects, you will have to follow the doctor's instructions and take the medication regularly. You will also have to avoid alcohol. You will have to avoid alcohol because alcohol is one of the main causes of the side effects of the medication."

Prompt: 'What is the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?\n' 
Generated text: '\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused by a brain-destroying protein called prion. Prion diseases are extremely rare and have no known cure.\n\nWhat causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?\n\nResearchers have long known that prions are the cause of CJD. What they didn’t know was how the proteins are formed.\n\nFor years scientists have known that the protein is misfolded. But they didn’t understand how the misfolding occurs.\n\nIn a new study, a team of researchers from the University of Cambridge in England and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, discovered that the prions they studied are the result of a “breakdown” of a single amino acid.\n\nThey also discovered that this amino acid, called glycine, was being rapidly broken down in the brains of patients with CJD.\n\nThe researchers believe the discovery could help them develop new treatments for the disease.\n\nWhat are prions?\n\nPrions are a group of protein misfolding diseases that cause the death of brain cells. The most well-known prion diseases are scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is commonly called “mad cow disease.”\n\n“Prion diseases are extremely rare, and have no known cure. They are caused by misfolding of normally harmless proteins, leading to the formation of a misfolded protein called a prion. This protein then infects other proteins, causing them to misfold and become a prion as well,” the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) explained.\n\nWhat is CJD?\n\nCJD, also known as “vCJD” or “prion disease,” is a prion disease. It can only be caused by a misfolded protein called a prion.\n\n“When a person becomes infected with the CJD prion, the prion forms a structure called a prion protein. The prion protein then misfolds and forms insoluble aggregates (‘prion-like particles’) inside brain cells,” NINDS explained.\n\nThese prions are then transported to the brain stem and spinal cord, where they begin to destroy brain cells, the NIH explained.\n\nThe disease progresses rapidly. Over time, more and more brain cells are destroyed.\n\nCJD is one of the most severe human prion diseases. At present, there is no cure for CJD. However, a person can survive the disease if they are diagnosed and treated early.\n\nHow is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosed?\n\nLike other prion diseases, CJD cannot be diagnosed by looking at the patient. Rather, it is diagnosed by detecting the presence of the prions in a sample of brain tissue.\n\nIn the past, CJD was diagnosed by examining brain tissue samples for signs of misfolded proteins. But these methods were extremely invasive and produced only a small number of cases.\n\nA new method of detecting the disease was developed in the 1980s. This method involves testing blood, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of prions.\n\nA blood test for prions is currently the main way to diagnose CJD. However, this method is not very accurate.\n\nA saliva test is also sometimes used to diagnose the disease. But this method is very difficult to perform because it requires taking samples of saliva from a person’s mouth.\n\nCJD can also be diagnosed by testing cerebrospinal fluid. However, this test is not used as often because it requires doctors to use a special test kit.\n\nHow is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease treated?\n\nThere is no cure for CJD. However, some treatments are available to help patients deal with the disease.\n\nDoctors can treat the disease by removing the diseased tissue. This is usually done by surgically removing a small piece of tissue from the front of the brain.\n\nDoctors also treat the disease by giving patients anti-seizure medication.\n\nCJD can be treated by taking a drug called “brincidofovir.” This drug is only available in Europe, and it is used to treat other prion diseases.\n\nThe drug works by preventing the misfolded proteins from forming. But it doesn’t cure the disease.\n\nIn addition, doctors can also treat CJD by using a drug called “galactose-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase inhibitor.” This drug works by increasing the amount of a sugar found in the blood. This sugar may help patients with the disease.\n\nWhen does Creutzfeldt-J'

Prompt: 'What are the types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nIn Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, amyloid deposits form in the brain and spinal cord, and it is characterized by symptoms such as dementia, muscle weakness, abnormal behaviour and abnormal mental status.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, which means it is caused by a mutation in a gene. People inherit two copies of the gene from each parent, and each one of these copies can contain one or two mutations.\n\nPeople with one mutated copy of the gene, which is inherited from their father, are at risk of developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The risk of developing this condition is greater if the mutated copy is inherited from the mother because a child inherits two copies of the gene from both parents.\n\nPeople with two mutated copies of the gene are considered to have two separate types of the disease. The two types are sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a sporadic form of the disease, and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a family form of the disease.\n\nThe two types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are considered to be quite different because the symptoms of the two types vary. For example, people with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually develop signs of dementia and mental decline after the age of 50. This is not the case with people with the familial form of the disease, who develop signs of the disease early in life.'

Generated text: "\nCJD is a rare, fatal brain disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. It can occur in people of any age and race.\n\nThere is currently no cure for CJD. There are several treatments that have been tried with some success. The treatments are used to stop the growth of the brain cells that die as a result of the disease.\n\nIt is important to seek medical help as soon as you suspect you may have CJD. Treatment may prolong the time before the first symptoms appear. Treatment can slow the progression of CJD, but it cannot stop it.\n\nThe following is an overview of the treatment options:\n\nMedications\n\nThere are several medications that are used to treat CJD. The following medications are sometimes used as first-line treatments:\n\nAzathioprine (Imuran)\n\nLemtrada (lemuradrine)\n\nRituximab\n\nThe drugs are given by mouth or intravenously. They have been shown to be effective for stopping the growth of brain cells in people who have been diagnosed with early-onset CJD.\n\nSurgery\n\nSurgery is sometimes used to remove affected tissue. The following surgical options are available:\n\nExtirpation\n\nThis procedure involves removing the entire diseased brain and spinal cord. The procedure is very difficult to do, and it is rarely done.\n\nVitrectomy\n\nThis procedure removes the vitreous, the gel-like material that fills the back of the eye. The gel contains cells that are similar to those found in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nTransplantation\n\nThe diseased tissue is replaced with healthy tissue from a donor.\n\nThere have been some cases in which this surgery was done successfully.\n\nCerebral perfusion\n\nThis procedure involves using a technique called cerebral perfusion to replace the diseased brain tissue. The procedure involves using a special machine that pumps brain cells through the damaged tissue.\n\nThe idea is that the healthy cells will replace the diseased cells.\n\nThis procedure has never been done in humans.\n\nWhat are the complications of treatment?\n\nSide effects of some of the medications are serious. They include:\n\nNausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\n\nArthritis\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nHives\n\nBruising\n\nThe medications do not work for everyone. If you are treated with one of these medications, you will need to have a blood test every two to four weeks to check your blood levels of the drug.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for a person with CJD?\n\nCJD is a rare, fatal disease. People who have been diagnosed with early-onset CJD may live for years after diagnosis. However, the disease can affect the brain cells in many different ways. There is currently no cure for CJD.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of early-onset CJD?\n\nEarly-onset CJD has symptoms very similar to those of Alzheimer’s disease. The following are the symptoms of early-onset CJD:\n\nA gradual decline in memory and thinking abilities\n\nConfusion\n\nLoss of physical skills\n\nPoor judgment and balance\n\nThe symptoms usually appear in the second or third decade of life.\n\nWhat is the treatment for early-onset CJD?\n\nThere is currently no treatment for early-onset CJD. The goal is to slow the progression of the disease.\n\nHow can I get more information about CJD?\n\nYou can obtain more information about CJD at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). You can also contact the CJD Registry to get more information.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThis article was provided by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

Generated text: "In July 2008, the US FDA approved vorinostat (Vyxeos) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Two years later, the company Genentech received approval from the European Commission for the same indication.\nHowever, in May 2011, FDA withdrew approval for the drug in the US, as the agency found that the drug didn't work in a clinical trial. The European approval was subsequently withdrawn in 2012.\nBy then, GSK had acquired the rights to vorinostat. The company then filed an application with the FDA to modify the design of the original trial. The agency accepted the application and the company received a complete response letter (CRL) in April 2015.\nThe company appealed against the rejection and the matter went to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In August 2016, the court ruled in favor of GSK, clearing the way for the approval of vorinostat.\nThe decision was welcomed by the company, but it came with a warning - the FDA could withdraw approval for vorinostat at any time.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved the drug for the treatment of CLL and SLL.\nThe FDA approval of the drug was based on data from the original trial, which was modified. But GSK was required to provide additional information from a long-running phase II trial in China and an additional phase III trial in the US.\nIn November 2017, the company received approval in China for vorinostat as an add-on treatment to Rituximab for CLL and SLL patients who have failed to respond to Rituximab.\nVorinostat has been approved in Japan and the company has secured regulatory approvals in a number of other countries.\nIn September 2019, GSK announced that it would increase the number of patients enrolled in the phase III trial for vorinostat. The company said that it would increase the enrollment target to 570 patients to support potential approval in the US, as well as to support the filing of an application with the European Commission.\nWhy the variant CJD compensation scheme?\nThere are currently four ongoing phase III trials for vorinostat - the one in the US, the one in China, the one in Europe and the one in Japan.\nThe company plans to announce the results of the China trial in the first half of 2021, and plans to file the results of the US trial with the FDA and the European Commission in the first half of 2022.\nThe company is also planning to file results of the phase III trial in Europe in the first half of 2022, and the phase III trial in Japan in the second half of 2022.\nVorinostat is being developed for the treatment of CLL and SLL. It is being tested as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.\nThe drug is also being tested in the phase III trial for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\nThe compensation scheme\nIn July 2013, the US government filed a lawsuit against GSK over its failure to disclose the potential for vorinostat to cause brain damage, neurological complications and death. The government sought $1.2 billion in damages.\nHowever, the government dropped its case in July 2016, when the company agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve the dispute. The agreement included a $2 billion cash payment and $1.2 billion in patient compensation.\nThe settlement was finalized in January 2017. As part of the agreement, GSK will compensate patients with CLL and SLL who received vorinostat between 2007 and 2012.\nAs part of the settlement, the US government will distribute a one-time cash payment to eligible patients. The amount of the payment will be determined by the value of a patient's health insurance, and will be paid to the patient's insurance company.\nHowever, the settlement does not include eligible patients who received vorinostat in China.\nThe settlement also does not include eligible patients who received vorinostat as part of a clinical trial in the US.\nPatients who received vorinostat in the US will be eligible for the settlement if they received the drug at one of the following locations:"

Prompt: 'What is HIV and how does it affect the body?\n' 
Generated text: '\nWhat is HIV?\n\nHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. HIV attacks the T-cells which are the white blood cells that are part of the body’s immune system. When the immune system is compromised, it allows the virus to enter the body’s cells and replicate. This can lead to severe complications such as infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancers.\n\nWhat causes HIV?\n\nThe virus that causes HIV is known as the HIV-1 strain. The HIV-1 strain was first discovered in 1983 in the U.S. and in 1985 in Africa. Since then, there have been many strains of HIV and it is estimated that there are around 70 million people infected worldwide.\n\nHow is HIV spread?\n\nHIV is spread from one person to another through bodily fluids, such as semen, blood, breast milk and vaginal fluids. HIV can also be transmitted through the mother’s placenta after birth. It can also spread from mother to child through contact with infected blood or a needle.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?\n\nHIV is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus and it attacks the immune system. The symptoms of HIV include:\n\nAching joints and muscles\n\nFatigue and loss of appetite\n\nFever\n\nNight sweats\n\nStomach pain\n\nHIV can also damage the nervous system and the immune system. There is no cure for HIV, however, there are treatments that can manage the effects of the virus.\n\nWhat is the cure for HIV?\n\nThere are no cures for HIV, however, there are treatments that can manage the effects of the virus. There are also many medications available that can help to manage the symptoms of HIV.\n\nHow do I know if I have HIV?\n\nHIV is easily spread and there is no specific test that can detect the virus. The only way to know if you have HIV is through a blood test that can detect antibodies that the virus produces. Antibodies are the body’s way of attacking the virus and they are present in the blood when someone is infected. If the virus is detected in the blood, then it is a sign that the person has HIV.\n\nWhat is the treatment for HIV?\n\nThere are several medications that can be used to help to manage the symptoms of HIV. There are also many medications available that can help to manage the symptoms of HIV. The most common medications used to manage HIV are anti-retroviral medications. These medications can reduce the amount of virus in the body. Anti-retroviral medications also help to keep the virus from spreading to other cells.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for HIV?\n\nThere is no cure for HIV, however, there are medications that can manage the effects of the virus. There are also many medications available that can help to manage the symptoms of HIV. There is also a possibility that medications can be used to stop the HIV virus from spreading to other cells.\n\nIt is important to get tested for HIV as soon as possible if you have had unprotected sexual contact with someone who has HIV. If you have a compromised immune system, then you are at greater risk for contracting HIV and you should see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCarolyn J.

Prompt: 'What causes laryngitis besides cold or flu infection?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nAccording to WebMD, several causes of laryngitis exist. Infections, including cold and flu, can be a cause of laryngitis, and so can allergies and irritations. Viral infections, such as the common cold, can cause swelling and irritation in the throat, resulting in laryngitis.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nInfluenza, or the common cold, is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the throat and the larynx. The virus enters the body through the nose and then makes its way to the throat and larynx, causing sore throat and sneezing. Laryngitis can also be caused by allergies. Common allergies include seasonal allergies, hay fever and pet dander. Inhaling allergens through the nose causes irritation to the throat and the larynx, which can cause laryngitis.\n\nOther causes of laryngitis include a vocal cord infection, a condition called oropharyngeal candidiasis and bacterial infection. Infections of the larynx can cause swelling in the throat, and a vocal cord infection can cause a sore throat and sore larynx. Bacterial infections, such as tonsillitis and laryngitis, are caused by bacteria that enter the body through the throat and the larynx. In some cases, bacteria can also cause scarring in the throat, which can make breathing difficult.'

Prompt: 'What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMore than one-quarter of cases of multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, are unknown to doctors.\n\nHow do I know if I have multiple sclerosis?\n\nIf you have any of the following symptoms, you may have MS:\n\nPain and numbness in your arms, legs, or face.\n\nSudden, sharp pain in your head or neck.\n\nVision problems, such as blurred or double vision.\n\nFeeling of warmth or tingling in your arms or legs.\n\nLeg pain, trouble walking, or falling.\n\nYou may also have more than one of these symptoms. Some people have more symptoms than others.\n\nWhat is MS?\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects your central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and nerves). The immune system attacks and inflames the protective myelin sheath that coats your nerves. This damages the nerves and disrupts your ability to control your muscles, including your vision and balance.\n\nMS is an unpredictable disease that affects people of all ages and races. It is more common in young adults and women than in men.\n\nWhat causes multiple sclerosis?\n\nScientists don’t know the cause of MS, but they think several factors contribute. Some of these factors are inherited. In some families, it is more common for someone to develop MS than in others.\n\nOther risk factors are related to your general health. For example, smoking, poor nutrition, and being overweight can make you more likely to have MS.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?\n\nMS can cause a wide variety of symptoms. Many of these symptoms get better over time. If you have the first few symptoms, it may take time for your doctor to confirm the diagnosis of MS.\n\nIn some people, symptoms may be mild and be very difficult to recognize. Some people with MS have mild symptoms that only show up when they’re under stress. Others have more severe symptoms that are easier to recognize.\n\nOther symptoms may come and go. For example, some people have mild symptoms for months or even years before they get worse. Some people with MS may have no symptoms at all.\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?\n\nTo confirm a diagnosis of MS, your doctor may ask you to do certain tests and then look at your medical history and symptoms. You may also have a series of tests to help confirm your diagnosis.\n\nYour doctor may do the following tests:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This test uses a strong magnetic field to help show the structure of your brain and spinal cord.\n\nElectroencephalography (EEG). This test records the electrical activity of the brain. It is used to help diagnose MS or help find out if MS is causing any problems with your nervous system.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This test uses a magnet to measure how well your brain is working. It is used to help diagnose MS or to see if MS is causing any problems with your nervous system.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. This test measures the amount of fluid in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBlood tests. These tests measure your levels of proteins and other substances in your blood. They are used to help confirm the diagnosis of MS or to help find out if MS is causing any problems with your nervous system.\n\nA neurologist, or doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system disorders, may also do a brain biopsy. This involves drilling a hole in the skull to take a sample of brain tissue.\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis treated?\n\nThere is no cure for MS. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease.\n\nYour doctor will probably give you an MS medication. This medication may help control your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Some medications can even prevent the progression of the disease.\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\nPhysical therapy. Physical therapists can help you with muscle and balance problems caused by MS. They can also help you strengthen your muscles and improve your posture.\n\nSpeech, language, and swallowing therapy. Speech and language specialists can help you with speech problems and other swallowing problems caused by MS. They can also teach you ways to eat, drink, and swallow safely.\n\nOccupational therapy. Occupational therapists can help you with problems caused by MS that affect your work, school, or play.\n\nHome health care. Home health care nurses, nurses, and other health care workers can help you with your daily activities, such as bathing, grooming, dressing, and using the toilet.\n\nWho can I talk to about multiple sclerosis?\n\nYou can talk to your health care provider about your symptoms. You may want to ask your health care provider for a referral to a neurologist.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone'

Prompt: 'What is the outlook for people with multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: "\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe outlook for people with multiple sclerosis is good, according to Dr. Susan H. Haig, a neurologist at the Medical College of Georgia. People with multiple sclerosis may develop complications such as pneumonia, stroke or Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nPeople with multiple sclerosis have a 30 percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetime, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. MS is the most common neurological disease in young adults in the United States. Symptoms typically appear in the 20s and 30s, but in rare cases, symptoms appear in adolescence or adulthood.\n\nA person's risk of developing MS increases if a family member has the condition, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Smoking and obesity are associated with a higher risk of developing MS. Certain types of infections, smoking, head injuries and viral infections are also associated with an increased risk of MS.\n\nAccording to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, MS can be treated effectively if symptoms are caught early. Symptoms may include visual problems, fatigue and bladder problems. Treatment usually focuses on decreasing muscle weakness, improving mobility and controlling symptoms. Medications may be prescribed to treat vision problems and pain.\n\nTreatment for MS is not curative, but it may slow the progression of the disease and improve quality of life. The most common treatment is a drug called interferon, which attacks the immune system and may slow the progression of the disease. Other medications may be prescribed to treat vision problems, bladder problems, pain and other symptoms.\n\nMultiple sclerosis can also be treated with immunosuppressive medications, which suppress the immune system to help prevent the disease from worsening, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nA combination of therapies is the most effective treatment for people with relapsing remitting MS.

Prompt: 'Comment est-ce que le VIH endommage le système immunitaire ?\n' 
Generated text: '\nSi le virus transmite aux cellules du corps humain, il a-t-il la même effet sur les cellules du système immunitaire, comme l’explique Patrick Séjourné, médecin oncologue, à l’origine du projet « La fonction des anticorps anti-HIV », qui a reçu la mise en place d’un nouveau fonds de recherche à l’IRCCS, le 3 août dernier.\n\nVous avez été à Paris pour présenter ce projet ?\n\nOui, je me suis rendu pour présenter ce projet au sein du groupe anti-HIV, qui compte d’ores et déjà plus de 200 chercheurs et chercheuses. La raison était simple : il s’agit d’une étude tousiours plus large et plus complete que j’ai jamais eu auparavant.\n\nPourquoi ?\n\nParce que les derniers travaux, en février 2012, ont montré que, contrairement à ce que l’on pensait, le virus ne ne pouvait pas être endommagé du tout. Il n’est pas infecté par le système immunitaire. D’autre part, la mortalité n’a pas augmenté et, dernièrement, le virus a été enregistré dans une moindre proportion de malades.\n\nMais est-ce que l’on ne peut pas reprocher aux systèmes immunitaires d’être trop faibles ?\n\nD’autant plus qu’il y a un consensus scientifique pour dire que leur niveau a été dégradé par l’utilisation de trazodone, qui est l’une des médicaments contre le VIH. C’est pourquoi, lors de la conférence de presse, j’ai proposé de faire le lien entre l’augmentation du nombre de malades et l’augmentation de trazodone. Cela n’a pas été acepté.\n\nEst-ce que le virus peut provoquer un déficit immunitaire ?\n\nJe n’ai pas fait des études clés pour être sûr de mes conclusions. Mais j’ai vu de très bons résultats dans les laboratoires, qui me donnent l’impression que les anticorps qui sont produits contre le virus ont plus de moyens de se déployer.\n\nPourquoi ne pas préciser ces conclusions dans votre étude ?\n\nJ’ai voulu faire une évaluation générale de ce qui a été comme le pire heureux et le pire négatif pour le système immunitaire, qui était le surdoué. J’ai eu bien peur de l’être, car j’ai vu l’utilisation de trazodone entraîner de grandes pertes. C’est d’autant plus vrai que les chercheurs qui sont à l’origine du projet « La fonction des anticorps anti-HIV » sont sur le chemin de la publication d’une étude qui leur permet de décrire la relation entre ce qu’ils ont réalisé et l’impact sur l’autre.\n\nQuelles sont les principales conclusions de votre étude ?\n\nLes résultats nous montrent que le niveau de trazodone dans le sang est très lourd. Mais il faut reconnaître que cela n’a pas influencé la mortalité du virus. Nous allons donc continuer notre étude pour savoir si ces résultats se confirment. L’objectif du projet est d’évaluer si, malgré cette application dangereuse de trazodone, le système immunitaire du déficit est en bonne s'

Prompt: 'Quels sont les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques ?\n' 
Generated text: "La sclérose en plaques est une forme de sclérose en plaques (SSP) qui a été définie en 2005 par le Comité international de l'etude de la sclérose en plaques (CIESP). Elle se manifeste par des signes collatéraux, des symptômes comme des difficultés à se mettre à jour, de la fatigue et d'autres infirmités mais en plus des maladies du cerveau, de l'estomac, du système nerveux, du cœur et des épaules, des yeux et du cerveau, des membres du corps digestif et du système immunitaire. En raison de ces signes, le patient est atteint d'une sclérose en plaques. La sclérose en plaques est une maladie chronique et tend à avoir une progression linéaire. Elle peut s'aggraver à la suite de réactions allergiques, mais surtout en raison de la faiblesse des glissières."

Il faut s’en passer pour connaître s’il s’agit de la sclérose en plaques.\n\nPour le diagnostic, il suffit de faire une prise de sang.\n\nD’après un rapport de l’Istituto Superiore di Sanità publié en mars, « les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques sont l’éclatement de la péridurale et la formation de cartilages ferrés dans l’utérus. Ceux de la sclérose amyloidique sont la fréquence de résistance à l’hépatite B et la formation de cartilages dans le cerveau ».\n\nUn traitement parfaitement adapté\n\nLa sclérose en plaques est une maladie où le sang ne passe pas dans le système immunitaire. Il n’est donc pas possible d’éliminer le traitement parfaitement adapté, présenté par l’association La Ligue internationale contre la sclérose en plaques (LISP), mais surtout, un traitement léger et dur.\n\nMais c’est la sclérose en plaques qui peut se réduire à la sclérose en plaques sclérose amyloidique. « C’est le cas de moins de 15 % des cas. Cela signifie que le lien entre le sang et le cerveau est régulé, avec un développement normal », explique le professeur David de Boer.\n\nCe n’est pas seulement l’hépatite B qui peut être la cause de la sclérose en plaques, mais aussi l’hépatite C, le type A, ou encore l’hépatite C-reactive, qui est une forme plus grave.\n\nPour le moment, un traitement de l’hépatite C n’existe pas. « Mais il y a des travaux en cours et la sclérose en plaques peut être traitée, avec un traitement très peu chiant, de l’hépatite C », indique David de Boer.\n\nCette maladie est très difficile à diagnostiquer.

Prompt: 'What are some of the risk factors of high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: "\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThere are three risk factors that can lead to high blood pressure: obesity, smoking and genetics, according to WebMD. The risk of high blood pressure can increase with age. In fact, only 17 percent of adults over the age of 20 and 23 percent of those over the age of 60 have high blood pressure, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nObesity, high cholesterol and a lack of physical activity are risk factors for high blood pressure, according to WebMD. High cholesterol is a condition in which the body does not produce enough cholesterol. A lack of physical activity causes the body to become overweight or obese. This results in high blood pressure.\n\nThe presence of high blood pressure in a person's family is also a risk factor for high blood pressure, according to WebMD. People with family members who have high blood pressure are more likely to have high blood pressure themselves. High blood pressure can also be a risk factor for other conditions."

The goal is to demonstrate how one can not only develop a theory, but apply it to a historical event.\n\nMy fieldwork will focus on the effects of the election of the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, in 2000. My theory will draw from the historical events of Mayors of London and the development of the government in the city of London.\n\nIn my opinion, in order for a government to function effectively it should be a system of interrelated systems. A government should be an interrelated system because the executive, legislative, and judicial branches need each other to function.\n\nThe first thing a government needs is a central body which is the executive. This body is responsible for the overall functioning of the government. The executive must be composed of a legislative branch and an independent judiciary.\n\nA government also needs a legislative branch. The legislative branch creates laws, which may include the spending of tax money and the making of new laws. The legislative branch also makes sure that the laws are not being broken by the executive branch. The legislative branch should also be independent of the executive branch.\n\nFinally, the government also needs a judicial branch. The judicial branch determines if the laws are being broken and if the executive and legislative branches are doing their jobs properly. The judicial branch is also responsible for determining if the government should be changed by a vote.\n\nThe three branches work together to make sure the government functions properly. If they do not work together, the government will not function properly.\n\nMy research will focus on the election of the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and the way the government was formed in London.

Prompt: 'How do steroids work to reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune conditions?\n' 
Generated text: 'How do steroids work?\nSteroids are powerful anti-inflammatories that have been used for decades to treat symptoms of autoimmune diseases and other conditions such as asthma and arthritis.\nAdvertisement\nThe body uses inflammation to fight off infection but it can also cause harm to the body and joints if it\'s over-activated. Steroids are an effective way to reduce inflammation and also reduce the body\'s immune response to infections, which can help treat autoimmune conditions.\nAn autoimmune condition is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmune diseases are common and can have a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain, swelling, and fever.\n"Steroids are immunosuppressants, meaning they help reduce the immune system\'s overactive response to an infection. This is helpful in people with autoimmune diseases, who often have an overactive immune system that\'s causing disease," explains Dr Annette K. Orr, a rheumatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Professor of Medicine at Ohio State University.\nHow do steroids work on the body?\nSteroids are immunosuppressants, meaning they help reduce the immune system\'s overactive response to an infection. This is helpful in people with autoimmune diseases, who often have an overactive immune system that\'s causing disease. Steroids are also used for other conditions such as asthma and arthritis, where inflammation can be troublesome.\nSteroids are effective at reducing inflammation, but they do not cure autoimmune diseases. Steroids suppress the immune system and it takes time for the body to fully recover from the effects of steroids.\n"Steroids are an effective way to treat people with autoimmune conditions, but steroids can only be used for so long before the immune system becomes resistant to them and needs to be treated with a different medication," explains Dr Orr.\nHow do steroids work for autoimmune diseases?\nOne of the ways steroids work is by preventing the body from producing inflammation-causing cytokines. Cytokines are proteins made by the immune system that can cause inflammation.\nIn people with autoimmune diseases, the immune system is overactive. This overactivity is caused by the body\'s own immune cells attacking the body.\nWhen the body responds to an infection by releasing inflammation-causing cytokines, it can cause long-term damage to the body.\nSteroids can reduce the body\'s immune response, which helps reduce the production of cytokines. Steroids can also reduce the body\'s immune response to infection, which can help treat autoimmune conditions.\n"Steroids can\'t treat the underlying cause of autoimmune diseases, but steroids can help reduce the inflammation and immune response, which is what causes the autoimmune response in the first place. Steroids can also help prevent autoimmune conditions from worsening," says Dr Orr.\nRead more about steroid treatment:'

Prompt: 'What are the different types of steroids and how are they administered?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe primary goal of steroid administration is to improve the body’s response to acute or chronic injury or illness. These treatments are typically administered via injection or oral administration, though there are other ways of delivering these drugs.\n\nThe most common oral steroid treatment is prednisone. The most common injection type is a hydrocortisone product.\n\nHydrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid that is most commonly prescribed for conditions that involve inflammation.\n\nInjections are most commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and the flu. Oral steroids are most commonly used to treat conditions such as cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, lupus, and asthma.'

Prompt: 'Quels sont les traitements pour la bronchite?\n' 
Generated text: '\nQuestion:\n\nWhat are the treatments for bronchitis?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the air passages that allow air to pass from the lungs to the outside. The bronchial tubes branch off from the trachea, which is the main air passage in the chest.\n\nTreatments for bronchitis include:\n\nover-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil)\n\nthe use of a nebulizer (a machine that turns liquid medicines into a mist that is inhaled)\n\nIf these treatments do not work, bronchitis can be treated with antibiotics. It can also be treated with steroids.\n\nBronchitis caused by colds or flu is usually not treated with antibiotics, but with OTC medications. Antibiotics are not usually recommended for bronchitis caused by viruses.\n\nSteroids are also used to treat bronchitis.\n\nIf your bronchitis does not get better, it may be caused by a serious condition called chronic bronchitis. This condition usually gets better on its own, but you should see your doctor if it does not.\n\nThis content is reviewed regularly and is updated when new and relevant evidence is made available.

Prompt: 'Comment fonctionnent les stéroïdes?\n' 
Generated text: "\nLes stéroïdes sont des hormones, issus des glandes livers, qui sont injectées directement dans le cerveau via le système nerveux basé sur le cerveau. Les hormones sont utilisées pour augmenter ou diminuer la production de neurone ou de neurotransmetteurs. Elles sont naturelles et sont produites toutes les deux jours. Mais quand elles ont un impact sur le système nerveux, ce sont des stéroïdes qui sont responsables.\n\nLe bilan des stéroïdes\n\nDès son injection, les hormones sont impliquées dans les mécanismes de production de neurone ou de neurotransmetteurs.\n\nLes effets des stéroïdes sont variés, par exemple :\n\n● La production de neurone : en zone sérieuse, celle-ci peut augmenter ou diminuer.\n\n● La production de neurotransmetteurs : en zone superficielle, la production peut augmenter ou diminuer.\n\n● Le rythme de régulation des régions sérieuses : en zone superficielle, celle-ci peut augmenter ou diminuer.\n\n● La régulation des régions superficielles : en zone sérieuse, celle-ci peut augmenter ou diminuer.\n\nAvantages et défauts des stéroïdes\n\nLes stéroïdes peuvent fournir des effets positifs sur le cerveau :\n\n● En zone superficielle, l'impact est favorable pour la production de neurone, de neurotransmetteurs, de rythme de régulation des régions sérieuses et de régulation des régions superficielles.\n\n● En zone sérieuse, l'impact est favorable pour la production de neurone, de neurotransmetteurs, de rythme de régulation des régions sérieuses et de régulation des régions superficielles.\n\n● La régulation des régions sérieuses : l'impact est favorable pour la régulation des régions sérieuses.\n\nLes effets des stéroïdes peuvent être négatifs, par exemple :\n\n● En zone superficielle, l'impact est négatif pour la production de neurone, de neurotransmetteurs, de rythme de régulation des régions sérieuses et de régulation des régions superficielles.\n\n● En zone sérieuse, l'impact est négatif pour la production de neurone, de neurotransmetteurs, de rythme de régulation des régions sérieuses et de régulation des régions superficielles.\n\n● La régulation des régions sérieuses : l'impact est négatif pour la régulation des régions sérieuses.\n\nPourquoi ne pas utiliser les stéroïdes?\n\nPourquoi ne pas utiliser les stéroïdes ? Les stéroïdes peuvent augmenter l'activité de la zone superficielle, ce qui peut nécessiter une augmentation du niveau de stéroïdes. Ce type d'augmentation de stéroïdes peut être dangereuse pour la santé physique ou médicale. Les stéroïdes peuvent augmenter la quantité de neurone produite. Cela peut être dangereux pour le fonctionnement de la régulation des régions sérieuses.\n\nPar exemple : si la régulation des régions sérieuses est affectée, l'apport de neurone peut être important.\n\nIl peut alors se produire un bilan de régulation de la régulation des régions sérieuses.\n\nLa régulation des régions sérieuses peut être une des plus grandes vulnérabilités de l'espèce.

Le président du conseil régional de Toulouse a décidé d’évacuer les malades de la Pitié-Salpêtrière vers le Centre hospitalier universitaire de Dijon (CHU-Dijon). En cause : la présence de stéroïdes à la Pitié-Salpêtrière, préservés en laboratoire et non prescrits aux patients.

Generated text: "La laryngite est une des causes de l'effacement du son et de la voix. Dans une période de sang, les voix se voient refroidies et s'effondrent. Cela signifie que l'effacement du son se produit par exemple dans la maladie de laryngite. Il est difficile de diagnostiquer cette maladie par la voix car elle se manifeste lentement. L'effacement du son peut être accompagné d'une secousse épouvantable.\nMais comment se faire diagnostiquer la laryngite? Le médecin a des outils d'expérience pour l'identifier, mais il doit également être au courant des symptômes. La laryngite a des signes communs avec un cancer de l'abdomen. L'effacement du son et de la voix peuvent être signés par une insuffisance de phénomène, tandis que le cancer peut développer des signes différents, par exemple une limitation de l'intérieur.\nDe façon plus précise, une laryngite définitie peut être diagnostiquée via les examens de l'épithète, des lèvres, des lèvres du cou, des fesses et d'autres organes du corps. L'épithète peut être palpé et l'épithète du cou examiné. Ces outils peuvent être utilisés lors des examens cliniques. Le médecin doit également écouter la voix. Cela peut être fait par le médecin en gardant l'utilisation d'un médium par exemple.\nComment les médecins diagnostiquent la laryngite?\nLa laryngite peut être diagnostiquée sous l'emprise d'un médium. Les médecins peuvent utiliser les médiums en gardant l'utilisation d'un médium. Les médiums peuvent être utilisés pour diagnostiquer les laryngites, mais ne seulement lorsque le médecin est parfaitement préparé.\nDe manière plus précise, les médecins peuvent utiliser une microphone à l'intérieur du corps, ce qui permet de géolocaliser la voix. C'est un outil qui permet de diagnosticner la laryngite sans perdre la capacité de suivre la voix et de diagnostiquer l'effacement du son. Les médiums peuvent être utilisés lorsqu'on a une série de symptômes communs avec une maladie de laryngite. Les médecins peuvent aussi utiliser des prélèvements de sang. Les prélèvements sont utilisés pour des raisons de précision.\nQuelles sont les différences entre le cancer de l'abdomen et la laryngite?\nLes symptômes communs des deux maladies sont la limitation de l'intérieur, de la voix et de l'effacement du son. La limitation de l'intérieur et de la voix est peut-être similaire entre le cancer de l'abdomen et la laryngite. La laryngite peut être diagnosticée via les examens de l'épithète et de l'organisme. La limitation de l'intérieur et de la voix peuvent être diagnosticés lors des examens du médium.\nQuels sont les symptômes des deux maladies?\nLes symptômes communs de la laryngite et du cancer de l'abdomen sont l'effacement du son et de la voix.

Prompt: 'Comment diagnostique-t-on la sclérose en plaques ?\n' 
Generated text: '\nLe quotidien britannique The Guardian publie le 3 avril 2018 un article d’une dizaine de pages sur cette question, qui est plus importante que le sujet du jour : l’épidémie de sclérose en plaques. Cette question est particulièrement sensible pour les personnes âgées, qui représentent environ 25 % de la population mondiale, et qui peuvent avoir des signes clairs de sclérose dès qu’il faut l’appliquer en amont de la mort. La plupart des personnes âgées ne prévoient pas l’âge de la mort précise, et le risque d’ailleurs est bien plus grand qu’on ne le croit. Toutefois, si le risque est bien plus grand que l’on le croit, il n’existe pas de diagnostic précoce et fiable.\n\nCe qui est étonnant, c’est que l’on sait plus ou moins tout sur les causes de la sclérose en plaques. La plupart des scientifiques sont persuadés que les molécules qui sont en cause ont une origine primordiale, ce qui explique le fait qu’elles soient déjà présentes dans le système immunitaire des bactéries. Le problème est que leur origine n’est pas encore connue. Il faut donc trouver un outil pour examiner ce système immunitaire et rechercher les molécules en cause. C’est l’essentiel de la recherche, en tout cas pour les cliniques qui sont là, mais cela ne s’est pas déjà fait pour les épidémies. Ce n’est pas vraiment ce qu’on fait dans une situation de crise sanitaire.\n\nUn des problèmes est que les molécules impliquées dans la sclérose en plaques ne présentent pas d’éléments spécifiques. Une molécule de la sclérose, la sclérose en plaques, peut être diagnostiquée avec un test d’organisation de la molécule, mais il ne reste pas de précisions sur la façon dont elle se forme et s’élève. En ce qui concerne la sclérose en plaques, il y a donc un problème de mise en avant de ce type d’éléments pour mener la recherche.\n\nLa sclérose en plaques peut être la première symptomatique de la maladie. Cela dit, ce n’est pas le cas pour les générations entières, et certains générations ne sont pas concernées. Certaines personnes ne prévoient pas leur âge de la mort précise et de la maladie de la sclérose en plaques ne présente aucune signe précoce.\n\nCe qui fait que l’on ne sait pas pour quel genre de malade la sclérose en plaques vient. Une génération qui prévoit déjà des symptômes de la sclérose en plaques est plus susceptible de vivre une période de maladie.\n\nIl est possible que la sclérose en plaques se développe plus tard, mais cela n’est pas certain. Il faut donc une stratégie de prévention, mais cela reste difficile à mettre en place. Il faut donc trouver la manière de mieux comprendre les causes de la sclérose en plaques, donc de mieux mieux mener cette recherche.\n\nUne autre hypothèse, c’est que la sclérose en plaques est une nouvelle forme de cancer ou de sclérose. Dans ces cas-là, il serait plus simple de commencer avec des anticorps. Une autre hypothèse, c'

Prompt: 'How is high blood pressure diagnosed and what is considered the ideal blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: "There are many ways to diagnose high blood pressure. Doctors use different blood tests to determine if high blood pressure is the reason behind an individual's symptoms. Other indicators, such as a large number of aortic stenosis or a history of heart disease, can be used to establish if the patient has high blood pressure.\nWhile doctors will use an individual's blood pressure to gauge the health of their heart and blood vessels, it is not always considered the most important number to keep track of. That's because blood pressure does not mean the same thing for everyone. A high blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean a patient is at risk for a heart attack or stroke, and a low blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean someone is at a lower risk.\nThe ideal blood pressure is calculated by a patient's age, weight, height, and gender. Doctors typically use the systolic blood pressure to assess the health of the heart, while the diastolic blood pressure indicates the health of the heart's arteries.\nWhat is the systolic blood pressure?\nThe systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure exerted on the heart muscle. It is the value that is shown in a person's blood pressure reading.\nA blood pressure reading of 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is considered normal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It's also known as a diastolic blood pressure.\nFor example, a person with a systolic blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg has a normal blood pressure. This person has a blood pressure of 120/80, but 80 is considered the lower limit of a normal reading.\nHow is the diastolic blood pressure calculated?\nDoctors also use the diastolic blood pressure to measure the health of the heart. The diastolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure exerted on the heart's arteries.\nA person's diastolic blood pressure is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure by the heart's beats per minute. The lower the diastolic blood pressure, the healthier the heart.\nA normal blood pressure reading is between 60 and 80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\nHow is the systolic blood pressure calculated?\nThe systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure exerted on the heart muscle when it beats. It is the value that is shown in a person's blood pressure reading.\nA blood pressure reading of 120/80 mm Hg is considered normal.\nThe lower limit of normal is considered 120/80 mm Hg.\nWhat is the ideal blood pressure?\nDoctors typically recommend maintaining a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mm Hg. This is considered the optimal blood pressure for most people.\nHowever, blood pressure readings are not always recorded accurately.

Prompt: 'What should I do if I have high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nAll blood pressure measurements taken during pregnancy are monitored by your obstetrician/gynecologist. If your blood pressure measurement reaches a level of 140/90 or more, your obstetrician will be consulted. The goal of treatment for high blood pressure is to keep it from getting any higher. If you have preeclampsia, your obstetrician will treat it aggressively, but high blood pressure can be successfully treated.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a common problem in pregnant women, and can affect your baby’s health. High blood pressure is the leading cause of maternal death. In fact, it is the number one cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States.\n\nHigh blood pressure is also called hypertension or hypertension-related hypertension. It is a condition in which the pressure of the blood in your arteries is too high. Hypertension is a major cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and blindness. If you have high blood pressure, you need to take it seriously, because it can be dangerous for your baby.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure during pregnancy?\n\nYou may have no symptoms at all. Most women have high blood pressure. Your obstetrician/gynecologist may notice symptoms in you.\n\nSymptoms of high blood pressure during pregnancy:\n\nHeadaches\n\nShortness of breath\n\nDizziness\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nFast heartbeat\n\nIrregular heartbeat\n\nFatigue\n\nHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?\n\nHigh blood pressure is diagnosed based on the blood pressure measurements taken by your obstetrician/gynecologist during pregnancy. The blood pressure measurement is called the systolic blood pressure.\n\nIf you have an abnormal blood pressure measurement, it will be discussed with you and you will be told to keep a blood pressure record. Your obstetrician/gynecologist will check your blood pressure again every 4 to 6 weeks until your pregnancy is over.\n\nThe blood pressure measurement is taken with a cuff that is placed around the upper arm. It is connected to a machine that records the pressure and also measures the pulse. The blood pressure measurement can also be taken with a stethoscope and a hand-held device called a sphygmomanometer.\n\nYour blood pressure is measured over several minutes. It is then calculated by a formula called the systolic and diastolic pressure.\n\nHigh blood pressure can be diagnosed when the measurements for systolic and diastolic pressures are over 140/90 or greater.\n\nIf your blood pressure is over 140/90, you will be referred to your obstetrician/gynecologist for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nWhat are the treatments for high blood pressure?\n\nYour obstetrician/gynecologist will decide on the best treatment for you. Treatments include:\n\nResting\n\nThe most important treatment for high blood pressure is rest. This is especially important for pregnant women with preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia must rest as much as possible. They should also avoid standing, bending, lifting or doing any activity that might cause additional strain on their kidneys.\n\nDrugs\n\nDrugs used to treat high blood pressure include:\n\nDiuretics, or pills that make you urinate more often\n\nLithium, a drug used to treat bipolar disorder\n\nAtrial fibrillation drugs, a class of drugs that are used to treat irregular heartbeat. This includes the drug warfarin, a blood thinner.\n\nMedications, such as beta-blockers, that are used to treat high blood pressure. Beta-blockers help decrease the force of the heartbeat.\n\nAntipsychotic drugs, a class of drugs that are used to treat schizophrenia.\n\nOxytocin, a drug that increases the amount of the hormone oxytocin in the body.\n\nDoppler monitoring, or testing the flow of blood through the heart\n\nDoppler is the use of sound waves to detect blood flow through the heart. Doppler is used to help diagnose heart problems. It is especially useful in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. Doppler is also used to check for the presence of coronary artery disease. It is a safe and accurate way to test the blood flow in the heart.\n\nDoppler allows the obstetrician/gynecologist to see the heart’s movement when the heart is beating. If there is a blockage in the blood flow through the heart, the heart will not move as much as it normally does. It will also beat more slowly.\n\nDoppler is a noninvasive test that is done with a special probe that is placed on the skin. The probe transmits sound waves through the body, which bounce off of the tissues. This allows the obstetrician/gynecologist to pick up the sound waves and determine the blood'

Prompt: 'What is bronchitis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nBronchitis is inflammation of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs. The tubes are called the bronchi. Bronchitis can happen to anyone, but it is more common in children and the elderly. When the inflammation and irritation of the bronchi continues, it is called chronic bronchitis.\n\nThe inflammation of the bronchi may be caused by a viral infection or an infection that is in your lungs. It can be caused by smoking, inhaling second-hand smoke, inhaling particles from dust or mold, or pollutants in the air.\n\nAn infected bronchus can cause white spots on your chest that are called bronchioles. Bronchioles are the small tubes that carry air from the lungs to the outside. When the bronchi get inflamed, they can become swollen and irritated.\n\nBronchitis can happen at any age, but it is more common in children than adults. One reason is that children are more likely to play in areas where others are playing, and more likely to play with toys that come in contact with other people. A viral infection is usually the cause of bronchitis in children.\n\nAdults are more likely to have an infection of their lungs. It is also more likely to be a chronic infection that has not gone away. This type of infection can be caused by smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke.\n\nBronchitis can also occur in adults that have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard for people to breathe. It is very common in older adults. In fact, COPD is the fourth most common cause of death in the United States.\n\nThe inflammatory cells in the bronchial tubes cause the inflammation and irritation. The cells produce a substance called inflammatory mediators. These mediators cause the inflammation and irritation in the bronchi.\n\nBronchitis can be treated with medications that reduce the inflammation of the bronchi. Some medications may be taken as an inhaler. Inhaling medications into the lungs helps reduce the inflammation and irritation of the bronchi.\n\nOther medications that can be taken to reduce the inflammation and irritation are taken in pill form.\n\nA bronchoscopy is done to identify the cause of the inflammation and irritation. Bronchoscopy is a procedure that uses a thin, lighted tube to examine the inside of the bronchi. This is done to identify the cause of the inflammation and irritation.\n\nSometimes bronchitis is treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics are taken by mouth, and they kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. This helps reduce the inflammation and irritation of the bronchi.'

However, if it is not treated properly, the patient may lose the ability to breathe, which may lead to pneumonia. There are different types of bronchitis. The most common is chronic bronchitis, which develops over a period of time, and the other types are acute and acute bronchitis. In case of acute bronchitis, the patient needs immediate medical attention because of the risk of complications.\n\nThe diagnosis of bronchitis is made by a physician. The doctor will first ask the patient about the symptoms and examine the lungs. Bronchoscopy is a procedure where a camera is inserted into the patient's lungs, which will help the doctor identify the exact cause of the disease. If the doctor suspects that the patient has bronchitis, he or she will prescribe medication. If the patient is not able to control the symptoms, the doctor will recommend hospitalization.\n\nThe treatment for bronchitis depends on the severity of the disease and the underlying health conditions. If the condition is mild and the patient does not have any underlying health problems, then the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic.

He\'s right. The CDC says e-cigarettes are unsafe for teens.\n\nThis is why the CDC has issued a warning about e-cigarettes: "Not only are they not safe, but they may serve as a gateway drug to smoking for young people. Some teens who use e-cigarettes will then try cigarettes, which are deadly."\n\nExperts say there is no way to know if e-cigarettes will lead to smoking.

Prompt: 'What are the symptoms of CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nCJD can develop in two ways: 1) from a "sporadic" person, meaning that the person has no family history of the disease and has no known exposure to the prion, or 2) from a person with an inherited predisposition to CJD.\n\nTransmission of CJD can occur from person to person, but only through blood transfusions and organ transplants.\n\nWhat is prion disease?\n\nPrion disease is a neurological disease that affects the brain and is characterized by the misfolding of protein. The protein is called "prion" because it looks like an "S." The misfolding of the protein creates misfolded proteins in the brain. These misfolded proteins can clump together to form what is called a "prion." A prion is not like normal protein, it is infectious and can be transmitted from person to person.\n\nCJD is caused by a prion protein that is misfolded in the brain. When a person develops CJD, the disease affects the brain and spinal cord. CJD can affect any part of the brain, but the most common location is the back of the brain, or in the cerebellum. In the brain, CJD can affect any part of the brain, but the most common location is the back of the brain, or in the cerebellum.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of CJD?\n\nCJD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms get worse over time. The symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. The symptoms of CJD are different from each other and may be mild, moderate, or severe.\n\nHow do you know if you have CJD?\n\nYou can test your blood for prions and blood transfusions and organ transplants for CJD.'

Prompt: 'What causes CJD?\n' 
Generated text: "\nThe causes of CJD are not fully understood. In the 1950s, CJD was called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In 1976, the name changed to Parkinson's disease.\n\nCJD is caused by the rare, genetic disorder, prion disease. CJD is a fatal, degenerative brain disease that affects all parts of the brain. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but there are cases of CJD with an X-linked pattern.\n\nThe most common form of CJD is the sporadic or sporadic type, which affects about one in a million people.\n\nCJD is not contagious. If the body makes proteins that are normal in the body, there is little risk of developing CJD.\n\nThe most common risk factors for CJD include:\n\nIntake of contaminated tissue, such as prions that have entered the blood stream.\n\nSitting or lying in the same position for long periods of time.\n\nBeing exposed to contaminated blood or other body fluids.\n\nExposure to infected food or animal products.\n\nA family history of CJD, or another neurological disease.\n\nCJD is also caused by the following:\n\nCJD caused by inherited mutations that have not yet been identified.\n\nCJD caused by in-vitro transmission of normal prions from one animal to another, which is called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).\n\nTreatment\n\nThe main treatment is supportive care. This includes watching the person carefully for signs of deterioration, and the gradual replacement of lost fluids and nutrition.\n\nThe prognosis depends on the age at which the person is diagnosed, the number of people in the family with CJD, and the extent of the symptoms.\n\nIn the United States, there are no approved treatments for CJD. The treatments that are currently available to control the symptoms of CJD may be helpful for reducing the risk of developing the disease, but they do not treat the disease."

It is caused by spontaneous mutations in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes for the prion protein (PrP). PrP is an essential component of the normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex, which is involved in the formation of prion proteins.\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) estimates that sporadic CJD affects approximately one in a million people worldwide. In the United States, there are an estimated 5 sporadic CJD cases per year.\n\nCJD is an inherited disorder.\n\nThe main risk factors for sporadic CJD are older age, male gender and a family history of CJD.\n\nHow is CJD caused?\n\nCJD is caused by the spontaneous mutations in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes for the prion protein. Prion proteins are normally a part of the normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex. PrPSc is involved in the formation of prion proteins. The normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex is normal and is not affected by the mutation. The prion protein (PrP) is the infectious form of a protein that is normally found in the brain of healthy people. The infectious prion protein (PrPSc) is the cause of the disease.\n\nHow is CJD diagnosed?\n\nThe first clinical diagnosis of CJD is usually made during autopsy when the individual has died. During autopsy, the presence of PrPSc in the brain is detected and the cause of death is determined. However, the diagnosis of CJD can be made with the help of a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a living individual.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for CJD?\n\nCJD is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. This means that symptoms appear slowly, and the symptoms may not be apparent for many years. As the disease progresses, the symptoms are likely to worsen. The cause of the disease has not been determined, and there is no cure. In the U.S., there are an estimated five sporadic cases per year.\n\nA person with CJD will often develop dementia. The onset of dementia usually occurs years after the first symptoms of CJD are noticed. However, some individuals may begin to develop dementia before the first symptoms are noticed.\n\nPeople with CJD may also experience loss of muscle control and balance, mental confusion, hallucinations and hallucinations, seizures, irritability, hallucinations, paranoia, delirium, or coma. Sometimes people with CJD may not show any symptoms for years or decades.\n\nWhat is the mechanism of sporadic CJD?\n\nThe cause of sporadic CJD is not yet known.\n\nHow is CJD caused?\n\nCJD is caused by the spontaneous mutations in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes for the prion protein.

Prompt: 'What is familial or inherited CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nCJD is a condition in which proteins from the brain’s nerve cells called neurons break down and leak into the blood. The proteins that leak can cause an abnormal accumulation of the protein prion in the brain.\n\nThe abnormal prion protein is then transmitted to other cells in the body, and can cause damage to those cells.\n\nCJD is rare. In the United States, about one in every one million people will develop CJD. There are no vaccines or treatments for CJD.\n\nHow is CJD inherited?\n\nCJD is usually inherited from a parent. The risk of developing CJD increases with the number of close relatives — a parent and child or a parent and sibling — who have had CJD.\n\nHow common is CJD in the U.S.?\n\nIt is rare. Between 1980 and 2015, there have been about 13 reported cases of CJD in the United States.\n\nHow can you tell if your loved one has CJD?\n\nCJD is an inherited disorder. It is not passed from person to person, so your loved one may have CJD without knowing it.\n\nWhat symptoms should I look for?\n\nSymptoms may appear years after the person first develops the condition. In many cases, symptoms don’t appear until later in life. In the U.S., most cases of CJD are diagnosed before age 60.\n\nCJD in a child\n\nSymptoms usually appear between the ages of 5 and 12 years.\n\nCJD in teens\n\nMost cases of CJD begin in teens or young adults.\n\nCJD in children and adults\n\nCJD is rare in children and adults.\n\nCJD in teens\n\nCJD usually does not cause symptoms until teens or young adults. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 15 and 30 years.\n\nCJD in adults\n\nMost cases of CJD begin in adults.\n\nCJD in children and adults\n\nCJD is rare in children and adults.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect a loved one has CJD?\n\nTalk with your healthcare provider about any symptoms you or your loved one has had, or any problems you have noticed in your loved one.\n\nIf you have a child who has symptoms of CJD, contact the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (P-CURU) at the University of California, San Francisco, Department of Pediatrics (CJD Unit) at 415-947-8300.'

Prompt: 'What is iatrogenic CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nIatrogenic CJD (iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a rare, fatal, human disease caused by a human retrovirus (human endogenous retrovirus, HERV). Iatrogenic CJD occurs when a person is given the retroviral immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to protect against a different disease (such as an infection). Such therapy was once common. Over the last decade, however, few people receive these antibodies.\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD is a rare variant, in which the iatrogenic antibodies cross the blood–brain barrier and cause damage to the brain. There is no evidence that the iatrogenic form of CJD is caused by any other human retrovirus. The main risk factors for iatrogenic CJD are the use of recombinant human insulin (human insulin gene transfer) for diabetes, and the use of human insulin or human insulin gene transfer for any other disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD can cause any of the following symptoms:\n\nA slight loss of balance or gait may be present\n\nLoss of muscle coordination, balance, or coordination of facial expression may be present\n\nA very slight loss of muscle tone and rigidity of limbs may be present.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of bladder control.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of coordination of facial expression.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD is a rapidly progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Death usually occurs within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In people who die of iatrogenic CJD, the following may be the cause:\n\nInability to eat or swallow, leading to malnutrition\n\nSevere brain damage\n\nAbsence of the part of the brain that controls movement\n\nHow to avoid or minimize iatrogenic CJD\n\nYou can reduce your risk of iatrogenic CJD by not receiving any human retrovirus immunoglobulin therapy, especially those that cross the blood–brain barrier. Treatment with human insulin is much less likely to cause iatrogenic CJD than treatment with human insulin gene transfer.\n\nFor information about HIV, AIDS, and other STD/HIV prevention topics, please visit the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care section of the CDC website.\n\nHow to recognize and prevent iatrogenic CJD\n\nThe following may increase your risk of iatrogenic CJD. If you develop any of the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately:\n\nA slight loss of balance or gait may be present.\n\nLoss of muscle coordination, balance, or coordination of facial expression may be present.\n\nA very slight loss of muscle tone and rigidity of limbs may be present.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of bladder control.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of coordination of facial expression.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD is a rapidly progressive disease with a poor prognosis.

Prompt: 'What are the complications of a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the most common complication of a heart attack is permanent heart damage. A heart attack can lead to heart failure, which means that the heart muscle can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of the body, and it can also cause angina, or chest pain. Other common complications include a heart attack-related disability, congestive heart failure and heart attack-related death.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nHeart attacks can be serious, even if they do not cause death. A heart attack can be a life-threatening condition, and it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible. The Mayo Clinic advises that signs of a heart attack include pain or discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, discomfort in one or both arms, back or jaw, shortness of breath or coughing up blood. The Mayo Clinic also notes that people with chest pain may have other symptoms, such as nausea, lightheadedness, sweating, indigestion or back pain.\n\nThe most effective treatment for heart attacks is to open up the coronary artery and restore blood flow. Treatment options include angioplasty and stenting, and the American Heart Association notes that these procedures are highly effective for treating heart attacks. The Mayo Clinic notes that stents can be placed in the coronary artery to reinforce or widen the artery.\n\nOther treatment options include medications, such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. The Mayo Clinic notes that beta blockers may be recommended for people who have heart failure. Other options include the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which are also available in combination with a calcium channel blocker.'

Prompt: 'How long does it take to recover from a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nRecovery from a heart attack can take as little as six weeks or as long as six months. The time it takes to recover depends on the severity of the attack and the age and health of the person affected. In general, a heart attack that results in death typically takes longer to recover from than an attack that does not result in death.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nRecovery from a heart attack can take longer if there was a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The person will need to have bypass surgery to clear the blockage. If a blockage is not found, recovery time can be significantly less than six weeks. In a heart attack that causes a minor injury to the heart muscle, recovery time can be up to six months, depending on how severe the damage is.\n\nA person who experiences a heart attack may need to take medication and may experience fatigue and weakness. They may also experience shortness of breath and may not be able to exert themselves as much. It is important that a person who has had a heart attack and is currently experiencing shortness of breath contact their doctor immediately. If a heart attack was caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries, the doctor may recommend a stress test or an angiogram.'

Prompt: 'What is the outlook for someone who has experienced a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe outlook is very good if you’re being treated by a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon who are members of the Heart & Vascular Center. These physicians are expert at treating heart attacks, heart conditions, and strokes.\n\nMost heart attacks occur in the left ventricle, which is located on the top of the heart. The lining of the heart is made up of many tiny blood vessels. The heart muscle is lined with a soft connective tissue called myocardium.\n\nWhen a heart attack occurs, the blood supply to the left side of the heart is blocked. The heart muscle is starved of oxygen-rich blood and begins to die. If the blockage is severe, the heart muscle can die, and if the blockage is not severe, the heart muscle can grow weaker.\n\nThe heart muscle can be healed by surgery, but in most cases, the heart will have to be replaced with a mechanical heart.\n\nMany heart attacks are caused by the build-up of fatty deposits known as plaque. These deposits can build up in the arteries, narrow the arteries, and form a blockage.\n\nPlaque builds up in the arteries when fat deposits build up on the arterial walls and block the flow of blood.\n\nThe good news is that the Heart & Vascular Center can help. The Heart & Vascular Center team of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, and nurses is one of the best in the world at treating heart attacks.\n\nDuring a heart attack, blood flow to the heart is cut off by a blood clot. The heart is starved of oxygen-rich blood, and the heart muscle begins to die. This can be fatal.\n\nThe blockage in the artery can be opened by removing the blood clot, which is done by means of catheterization. The catheter is placed into the artery and directed to the blockage. A balloon is then inflated, causing the blood clot to break up and the blockage to be removed.\n\nSurgery can be used to reopen the artery. However, if the artery is very narrow, the artery may need to be replaced with a mechanical heart.\n\nThese procedures can be done at the same time, or they can be done separately. The Heart & Vascular Center offers a wide range of treatment options to ensure that patients receive the best possible care.\n\nFor more information about a heart attack, heart disease, or a mechanical heart, call the Heart & Vascular Center at 615-355-6470.\n\nThe Heart & Vascular Center is an interdisciplinary team of physicians and nurses who provide the highest level of medical and surgical care for patients with heart disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.'

Les symptômes de la maladie sont liés à l'allergie et à des facteurs immunitaires. Pour l'instant, on ne connaît pas la cause de la maladie. Certaines personnes sont prédisponibles à la maladie. Elles sont ciblées par des dossiers d'immunisation de base.\nLes traitements\nL'immédiatement après le décès, une autopsie est recommandée. Ce dernier est conçu pour déterminer la cause de la mort. En cas de maladie de santé mentale, un épisode de surpoids et une infection sévère sont également diagnosticés. En cas de surpoids, la maladie peut être attribuée à une hypothèse genrée, le syndrome BPCO. En cas de infection sévère, on peut également établir la mort par infection sévère d'une maladie de santé mentale. Les traitements anticonvulsifs sont utilisés, mais il n'est pas toujours possible d'en assumer la consommation totale.\nOutre le diagnostic, la thérapie est conçue pour stimuler la régénération des cells, alors que le virus infecte les cells. Elle consiste à utiliser des antibiotiques généralement dans un médicament. Cependant, il n'existe toujours pas de thérapie efficace pour les bronchites chroniques obstructives.\nUn phénomène croissant\nLe phénomène de la bronchite chronique obstructive est croissant. L'immunité immunitaire à la maladie est probablement l'un des facteurs aggravants de la santé des patients. Il s'agit d'une maladie multiséquale qui est la seule cause de la mort d'autres maladies. Les personnes en risk devraient avoir un vaccin contre la maladie.\nBPCO : what is it and what is it not ?\nBPCO : what is it and what is it not ? Bronchitis bronchitis is a common, self-limiting inflammation of the bronchi. The inflammation causes the mucous membranes lining the bronchi to become inflamed, thickened, and inflamed. It can be one of the symptoms of a more serious condition, such as a cold, flu or other viral infection. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection or allergic reaction. In some cases, the inflammation can become permanent. There are two forms of bronchitis. In bronchial asthma, bronchial inflammation is the result of an asthma attack. It makes it harder to breathe because the airways are narrowed. With chronic bronchitis, the inflammation becomes permanent. In cases of chronic bronchitis, the inflammation is caused by a long-term exposure to irritants, such as smoke, dust, air pollution, and chemical fumes. Chronic bronchitis can be caused by smoking, poor hygiene, and exposure to smoke from second-hand smoke. The symptoms of chronic bronchitis are a chronic cough, which is worse in cold weather, and an inability to clear secretions. It is not common, but chronic bronchitis can cause serious complications, such as pneumonia. It is more common in people who smoke and in people with a history of smoking.\nBPCO : what is it and what is it not ? Bronchitis bronchitis is a common, self-limiting inflammation of the bronchi.

Generated text: '\nCes drogues médicinales sont parfois utilisées par des patients qui souhaitent obtenir une démence ou une douleur à la tête. Elles ont des effets secondaires potentiellement dangereux sur la santé.\n\nLe stéroïde léger (SL) a été désigné comme une drogue médicinale non seulement par la législation française, mais aussi dans une bonne partie de l’Union européenne. Il est un des plus connus et les plus utilisés des drogues médicinales.\n\nComme pour tous les stéroïdes, le SL a des effets secondaires potentiellement dangereux sur la santé. Il y a des raisons de penser que le SL est moins nocif que certains stéroïdes, comme les épicyclines, par exemple, mais le risque est toujours présent.\n\nLes effets secondaires de l’opioïde SL\n\nVous êtes à l’origine de l’opioïde SL. Quelle est votre personnalité humaine à la fois scientifique et sociologique?\n\nJe suis un ancien médecin, médecin de formation en sciences de la santé. J’ai été de plus en plus intéressé par la thérapie psychosociale. Il y a eu l’ère de la psychiatrie psychotraumatique, d’ouverture sur la psychothérapie et c’est à partir d’avant cette époque que j’ai commencé à m’intéresser aux drogues médicinales.\n\nIl y a tout de suite quelques questions que vous décidez d’émettre, par exemple, de la santé des patients: "Un patient vous demande de l’opérer. Comment dire non?"\n\nLe patient a des besoins et qu’on ne peut pas le réparer. Cela doit être fait dans le respect des lois et des règles.\n\nAujourd’hui, on a un certain nombre de pratiques pour faire respecter les lois et les règles. Mais on connaît bien les risques potentiels d’effets secondaires.\n\nJe peux tout de même répondre au premier question en le suivant: "Oui, c’est comme si vous lui dites qu’il n’est pas capable de payer le chirurgien, mais que vous lui donnez le droit de payer la pénalité s’il refusera de payer le chirurgien. Il y a une certaine contradiction qui peut se creuser."\n\nLes risques potentiels d’effets secondaires du SL sont bien connu et, surtout, des connaisseurs de la littérature sont en présence. J’ai fait partie d’une enquête nationale, qui s’est terminée en 2007. C’est le seul débat qui existe actuellement dans la littérature.\n\nPourquoi avez-vous développé une thérapie psychosociale avec l’opioïde SL?\n\nVous avez un patient qui souhaite obtenir une douleur à la tête. Dans le cas présent, il souhaite obtenir une douleur sans effets secondaires. En thérapie psychosociale, on développe les émotions, on énumère les défis.

Prompt: "Comment fonctionnent les stéroïdes et comment aident-ils à soulager les douleurs et l'inflammation?\n" 
Generated text: "Le stéroïde est une substance naturelle qui se trouve dans le sang et qui étend le corps. Elle agit en fonction du niveau de déficience biologique. Dans le cas où la douleur est douloureuse, elle agit sur la cellule de traitement du sang afin de diminuer les dégâts et d'améliorer la recouvrement de l'hémocène.\nPour aider à soulager les douleurs et l'inflammation, les stéroïdes ont des effets sur les récepteurs musculaires et l'hémocène.\nLes stéroïdes produisent plusieurs effets bénéfiques pour les douleurs. Il n'y a pas de précédent scientifique complémentaire sur les effets du stéroïde et les douleurs, mais une étude menée en 2005 sur les personnes avec le syndrome de Lyme a montré que les stéroïdes améliorent le niveau de circulation dans le corps et le système immunitaire. Les stéroïdes vont d'abord être admissibles à un dosage réglementé d'une semaine et doivent être utilisés avec des traitements et des mesures d'anticipation.\nMais ces traitements doivent être administrés avec un accompagnement clinique par des soignants, dans les hôpitaux, pour leur faire remonter le niveau de santé. C'est pourquoi il est important d'avoir une connaissance régulière du stéroïde et de ses utilisations.\nLe stéroïde est une substance naturelle que le corps n'a pas de préférence pour la consommer. Il se trouve dans le sang et peut être détecté dans la peau. L'homme peut aussi s'enrichir de l'héroïne, mais cela peut être difficile dans un monde enseveli dans la poussière.\nCe qui fait que le corps récupère les stéroïdes, ils sont régulièrement déversés de la peau. Les stéroïdes sont donc très difficiles à se procurer et donc bien moins dangereux que le tabac et des produits qui contiennent des stéroïdes.\nLes stéroïdes ont des effets sur les récepteurs musculaires et l'hémocène. Ces effets peuvent être d'une grande portée dans les cas où l'hémocène est un peu mal place.\nLes stéroïdes peuvent aussi être utiles pour l'amélioration des douleurs crânienne, musculaires et génitales. Les stéroïdes peuvent aussi améliorer la circulation des sangliers et aider à la recouvrement de l'hémocène.\nLes stéroïdes peuvent aussi aider à diminuer les effets néfastes de la sclérose en plaques, comme le déficit de précieuses hormones. Il existe des stéroïdes qui peuvent être utilisés pour les soins de santé général.\nVous pouvez utiliser les stéroïdes dans le cas de douleurs crânienne, musculaires et génitales.

C\'est une étude récente qui a montré qu\'une fois dans l\'organisme, les stéroïdes avaient une efficacité de 27 % pour guérir la polyarthrite rhumatoïde (PAH), qui est une forme de rhumatisme. Ce travail a été fait en collaboration avec une équipe de l\'Université de Pittsburgh, du musée de l\'Homme à la Sorbonne et de l\'Observatoire de l\'Etat du Rhum (EOR) à Paris.\n\nLes stéroïdes à base d\'azote peuvent-ils guérir des maladies telles que l\'asthme ou la polyarthrite rhumatoïde?\n\nIl est vrai que les stéroïdes peuvent guérir des maladies comme la PAH, mais ils peuvent aussi être utilisés pour le traitement d\'autres maladies comme l\'asthme. C\'est pour cela que leur utilisation contre l\'asthme est déjà actée, et c\'est ce qu\'on appelle le "travail des stéroïdes". Cela veut dire qu\'il existe des stéroïdes qui n\'intéressent pas les maladies à base de protéine, mais qui peuvent être utilisés pour le traitement de l\'asthme. Enfin, il y a des stéroïdes qui intéressent les protéines, mais qui ne peuvent pas être utilisés pour le traitement de l\'asthme, parce que ces protéines sont déjà protégées par un deuxième système. Il n\'y a donc pas de problème de détection d\'un détenteur de stéroïdes.\n\nVous savez, dans le domaine de la médecine, il y a un ensemble de pratiques qui sont prises. Il y a les pratiques qui ne sont pas décidées par les chercheurs. C\'est le cas du traitement de l\'asthme. Il n\'y a pas de consensus scientifique sur la manière à faire dans le domaine de la médecine. C\'est pour cela que, parfois, on fait des équipes qui se défendent d\'être les "biens de l\'ordre" et qui se foutent de ceux qui ne comprennent pas.\n\nIl y a également deux types de stéroïdes. Ceux qui travaillent sur le protéine, ce sont les stéroïdes du système des protéines. C\'est en effet ce qu\'on appelle le "travail des stéroïdes". Il est vrai qu\'ils travaillent sur le protéine. Les travaux sur ces stéroïdes sont très conçus, on a donc des tests clairs, et on peut détecter les détenteurs de stéroïdes.\n\nIl y a ensuite les stéroïdes qui travaillent sur la protéine.

Dans cette étude, des auteurs de l’article ont voulu déterminer si les stéroïdes pour l’asthme, en particulier ceux des chemises, sont effectivement lésés par le cerveau.\n\nCes médicaments, si elles sont déjà lésées par le cerveau, doivent être lésées à travers une chemise bien isolée.\n\nCette étude, que le journal a pu consulter, n’est pas encore complète. Le déroulé des tests n’est pas encore mentionné.\n\nLes auteurs des études, dont Marc Menaubou, spécialiste des hôpitaux du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Montréal, et Karine Ouellet, présidente de l’Association des médecins et médecines allergistes et immunologistes du Québec, n’ont pas voulu commenter la réalité de leurs travaux.\n\nMais Marc Menaubou a expliqué que l’asthme ne peut pas être lésé par le cerveau. Le virus de l’asthme, nous le savons, est là, mais il n’y a pas de médicament qui lésera la contagiosité du virus.\n\nDans les règles de l’agence médicale québécoise des stéroïdes, les stéroïdes sont devenus administrés seulement à une dose équivalente à la dose lésée par le cerveau.\n\nLes stéroïdes pour l’asthme, dont les médicaments sont peu connu, sont issus du camp de la médecine informelle. Et leur route de l’administration est toute à eux. Il est impossible de savoir de quel système de distribution ils sont distribués.\n\nLes risques de contamination\n\nIl existe une petite liste d’intoxications à laquelle les stéroïdes pour l’asthme peuvent conduire. Des années de travaux ont révélé que les stéroïdes peuvent être toxiques pour les personnes âgées, les malades de type 1 qui ont un cerveau complètement lésé ou des patients en chute libre avec une maladie auto-immunitaire.\n\nLa dernière étude réalisée en 2016 par une équipe de l’université de Montréal montrait qu’un certain nombre d’échantillons de stéroïdes pour l’asthme avaient contaminé la région du ventre d’une personne.\n\nL’article publié dans La Presse oncologique suggère que cette contamination se fait sur un médicament qui est lésé sur les cerveaux en l’état, sans qu’il soit déposé à une dose à laquelle il pourrait être lésé sur le dos.\n\nAu Québec, des cas d’intoxication à des stéroïdes pour l’asthme sont importés. C’est le cas de l’échantillon de ce médicament qui a contaminé la région du ventre d’une personne. Cette contamination n’a pas été menée par les médicaments d’origine, mais par des stéroïdes de chirurgie.\n\nLes médicaments anti-asthme'

Generated text: '\nComment puis-je traiter moi-même une laryngite?\n\nThe Language of Healing by Sarah Crichton, M.D. and Robert Greene, M.D.\n\nI woke up this morning feeling a little worse than usual. I have a cold, but the worst of it seems to be in my voice box, which is a little annoying. I’m getting better, though, and not sounding too much like the voice of Bane from The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nI went to see a doctor today, and she told me that I have a laryngite. It’s when your larynx swells up and starts to make it difficult for you to talk. The doctor told me that it’s not a big deal, and that there are things I can do to treat it. I might not even have to go to the doctor.\n\nShe also told me that my voice is more important than my appearance. I think that’s a pretty important thing to tell a guy like me. I’m sure there are plenty of women out there who think that looks are more important than voice, but I don’t want to be one of them.\n\nThe doctor gave me some home remedies to try. I’ll try to remember to post about them.

When she woke up today she wasn’t able to talk very well, which is unusual for her. It was like a bad cold all over again – the voice box was hurting her.\n\nThey prescribed her some antibiotics for her cold. But she can’t take them because she’s pregnant and her body is making antibodies for the baby. So instead she’s going to try some home remedies – gargling with salt water, and using an over-the-counter medicine called “Boehringer’s Ear Balsam”.\n\nThe doctor said she might not even have to go to the doctor. If she can get the laryngite to go down on its own, she won’t need any antibiotics.\n\nHi John,\nI have a laryngite right now, and I’ve been giving my wife a hard time over it. It’s been bothering me for a week. It started out with some dry coughs and some pain, and then I started getting a voice crack when I spoke. It’s the strangest thing. I’m not sure if it’s a laryngite, but I’ve been taking some allergy medication and some throat lozenges and I’m hoping that it will go away soon.\n\nMy sister has a laryngite too. She gets them when she’s sick. I also have a cold and a sore throat right now. I think it’s a laryngite because I’m getting a voice crack when I speak. I hope you feel better soon.'

Prompt: 'Comment un pharmacien peut-il aider en cas de laryngite?\n' 
Generated text: "Cette question est posée en prévision de la Coupe du monde 2018, qui aura lieu dans l'automne de cette année et devrait se tenir dans le Qatar.\nEn prévision de la Coupe du monde 2018, un pharmacien doit-il être déterminé à donner un médicament à un patient pour améliorer son âge ou son état de santé? Si un patient est contrainte de subir une intervention chirurgicale, un pharmacien doit-il prendre la décision de donner un médicament à ce patient pour améliorer son état de santé? Si un patient développe une myopathie, un pharmacien doit-il lui donner un médicament pour augmenter la capacité de son cerveau?\nCette question est posée en prévision de la Coupe du monde 2018, qui aura lieu dans l'automne de cette année et devrait se tenir dans le Qatar. Cette coupe de football, qui suit la finale de la Ligue des champions de l'Europe et la finale de la Coupe de la Ligue, est souvent présentée comme le meilleur événement de la saison dans les pays du Golfe. Dans cette dernière édition, les équipes étrangères représentées sont à l'honneur dans la capitale du Qatar, où les règles du jeu sont très différentes des règles de l'UEFA.\nDe nombreuses questions sont posées pour ce qui concerne les sportifs et la protection des joueurs. Cette Coupe du monde 2018 a donc une importance qui est très importante. Cette question de laryngite est née après que la presse de Qatar a rapporté qu'un pharmacien aurait été débouté par un juge en raison d'une pratique qu'il avait pratiqué de donner des médicaments à des joueurs en hématologie. Dans le contexte du Qatar, il y a une histoire importante d'homophobie. Les gens qui jouent au football qui sont homosexuels sont pris au piège et dans le but de leur donner des médicaments qui servent à les empêcher de jouer.\nLe pharmacien est donc questionné à ce sujet et il doit se poser une question importante. Cette question est la même que celle de l'homophobie dans le Qatar. Il doit s'imaginer s'il y a un lien entre ce fait et la désinformation de l'homophobie. Dans un monde où les gens qui sont homosexuels sont stigmatisés et seront témoins de la violence que subissent, le pharmacien doit s'imaginer s'il y a un lien entre cette réalité et la pratique de donner des médicaments à des patients en hématologie. Il doit s'imaginer s'il y a un lien entre cette pratique et la prise en charge des patients qui sont en hématologie. Il doit s'imaginer s'il y a un lien entre la médecine qu'il offre et les questions qui lui sont posées.\nLes joueurs du football ne sont pas seuls à subir les dangers de la santé. Ils sont confrontés à différents risques et à différents risques qu'ils doivent soit en prendre la décision, soit en assumant le risque de se faire traiter et médicalement.

Mais dans certains cas, ce lancement peut aussi causer la laryngite, en raison de l\'action de la bactérie qui est observée sur le tissu laryngeal.\n"La laryngite est une maladie respiratoire importante, avec un taux de mortalité de 40% à 50%", souligne la Dr Fauci. "Elle se manifeste avec un effet de purgatoire, le long des lèvres et des pharynx, et un taux de mortalité moyen de 15% à 25%".\nL\'autre chose à faire c\'est de "ne pas utiliser de lubrifiants ou de lubricants de massage à cause de leur effet sur la larynx", ajoute l\'expert. "Cette limitation est aussi pertinente pour leurs usages en douche et avec les résultats d\'une douche en douce", ajoute-t-elle.\n"L\'utilisation d\'un produit de douche en douce peut aider à éviter un effet de purgatoire si vous voulez traiter votre maladie respiratoire", conclut la Dr Fauci.'

Prompt: 'What are steroids used for?\n' 
Generated text: "\nSteroids are drugs that increase the number of protein-creating cells in the body. These cells are called osteoblasts. It is the osteoblasts that create new bone tissue.\n\nSteroids are usually used for one of two reasons:\n\nTo treat conditions that affect the body's bone and cartilage:\n\nBreast cancer\n\nCancer of the bones\n\nCancer of the cartilage in the joints\n\nOther conditions that affect bone and cartilage\n\nTo treat conditions that affect the body's muscles, blood vessels, or other tissues:\n\nAnemia\n\nArthritis\n\nDepression\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nHyperthyroidism\n\nInterstitial cystitis\n\nLupus\n\nNerve pain\n\nSteroids are taken by mouth or injection. The most commonly used steroids are:\n\nAnabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS)\n\nTestosterone\n\nClomiphene\n\nMesterolone\n\nDianabol\n\nDianorex\n\nOxandrolone\n\nNandrolone\n\nStanozolol\n\nThere are many different kinds of steroids, and doctors and pharmacies usually give patients a choice of which kind to take.\n\nSteroids and the Endocrine System\n\nThe endocrine system is part of the body's internal control system. Its function is to tell cells and tissues how to work. It is made up of several different glands and tissues, including the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and mammary glands.\n\nThe endocrine system controls everything that happens to the body. It makes hormones that help to regulate many functions in the body. When the endocrine system is not working well, hormones are not being produced properly, and the body is not working well.\n\nThe most important hormones in the endocrine system are:\n\nTestosterone\n\nDHEA\n\nThe Endocrine System and Steroids\n\nSteroids are sometimes used to treat a condition that is related to the endocrine system. For example, a doctor might prescribe steroids if a patient has an overactive thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces hormones that control many functions in the body. When the thyroid gland is overactive, the hormones it makes are not working properly, and the body is not working well.\n\nSteroids can also be used to treat conditions that affect the muscles, blood vessels, or other tissues. For example, the following are conditions that steroids can help to treat:\n\nArthritis\n\nMuscle pain\n\nDepression\n\nAnemia\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nKidney disease\n\nLupus\n\nAnorexia\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nThese kinds of conditions can affect the bones and cartilage. For example, when the bones and cartilage are not working well, the body is not working properly.\n\nHow do steroids work?\n\nThe body is made up of about 100 billion cells. These cells are organized into tissues. In the body, there are five main tissues:\n\nOsteoblasts (bone cells)\n\nOsteocytes (cartilage cells)\n\nChondrocytes (cartilage cells)\n\nEndothelium\n\nSerosal tissue\n\nSteroids can be used to treat conditions that affect the endocrine system and the body's other tissues.\n\nThe osteoblasts are the cells that make new bone tissue. When a patient takes steroids, they can increase the number of osteoblasts in the body. This can help to prevent bone loss.\n\nThe osteocytes are the cells that make new cartilage tissue. When a patient takes steroids, they can increase the number of osteocytes in the body. This can help to prevent cartilage loss.\n\nThe osteoblasts and osteocytes work together to make new cartilage tissue. The end result is that the body's cartilage tissue is replaced.\n\nSteroids and Bone Loss\n\nMany people with bone loss are treated with steroids. The following are some conditions that may be treated with steroids:\n\nOsteoporosis\n\nOsteopetrosis (bone thinning)\n\nOsteonecrosis (bone death)\n\nTreatment with steroids can help to prevent bone loss.\n\nSteroids and Muscle Pain\n\nSteroids can help to reduce the symptoms of muscle pain. For example, they may help to treat:\n\nAnemia\n\nCancer\n\nDepression\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nHypertension\n\nInterstitial cystitis\n\nLupus\n\nNerve pain\n\nOsteoporosis\n\nThe muscles, blood vessels, and other tissues of the body can also become damaged. Steroids can help to treat conditions that affect these tissues.\n\nFor example, when the muscles are damaged,"

Prompt: 'What are the different types of steroids?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThere are two main types of steroids: anabolic steroids and androgenic steroids. The first are the male hormone, and the second are the female hormone. Both have the same chemical structure, and the effects of the two are similar.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nAnabolic steroids are chemically defined as steroids that are produced in the pituitary gland of the human brain. These steroids have the ability to stimulate the production of protein, especially muscle protein. This increases the muscle mass and strength of the person. These steroids are produced by the human body to stimulate growth, especially during adolescence. This hormone is called testosterone.\n\nAnabolic steroids are also sometimes referred to as androgenic steroids because they stimulate the growth of the male sex organs. Anabolic steroids can also cause a person to lose weight because they suppress the appetite. The opposite can also occur, especially during the period of puberty. During this time, anabolic steroids can cause excess body fat to accumulate in the body.\n\nAnabolic steroids are also used to treat conditions such as osteoporosis and certain types of cancer. These steroid drugs can stimulate bone growth in the body, and they may also decrease the growth of tumors.\n\nOn the other hand, androgenic steroids are also produced by the pituitary gland. This hormone is also known as the female hormone. Androgenic steroids, like the male hormones, also stimulate the production of protein in the body. This can lead to the growth of the female sex organs, including breast tissue, but it also causes hair growth and facial hair growth.\n\nThese steroids are also often used to treat hormonal problems, such as pregnancy, menopause, and the female hormone-induced condition called gynecomastia. Because they stimulate the growth of the female sex organs, these drugs can cause unwanted side effects. Androgenic steroids also stimulate the growth of body hair. These drugs are also used to treat hormone-dependent cancers, but these drugs can have adverse effects on the heart.'

Prompt: 'What are anabolic steroids, and how are they different from corticosteroids?\n' 
Generated text: "They are steroids. They're different because they are more anabolic.\nAnabolic steroids are a class of pharmaceutical drugs that, when ingested in high doses, can increase muscle protein synthesis and the rate of protein breakdown, as well as reduce fat tissue and increase lean body mass in humans. Anabolic steroids are different from corticosteroids because they are the most anabolic of the three classes of drugs and have been the focus of steroid abuse in sports for decades.\nIn the wake of the recent Sports Illustrated cover story about the use of steroids in baseball, many are left wondering: What are anabolic steroids and why are they banned in sports?\nMost people are familiar with the use of corticosteroids (including prednisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisone) in treating a variety of autoimmune conditions and inflammatory disorders. They work by inhibiting the synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, while also inhibiting the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-9, and IL-15. Corticosteroids are often the first-line treatment for autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and lupus nephritis.\nWhile corticosteroids are effective in treating many autoimmune conditions, they can cause serious side effects in certain patients, including thinning of the hair, thinning of the skin, acne, and significant weight gain. While corticosteroids are also used as anti-inflammatory medications to treat such conditions as asthma and inflammation of the joints, they are also used to suppress inflammation in other places in the body, including the lungs and the heart.\nBecause corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation in the lungs, asthma can develop in certain patients. While corticosteroids are also sometimes used to treat inflammation in the heart, this treatment is used sparingly because it can cause an increase in the blood pressure and heart rate.\nAnabolic steroids, on the other hand, are a class of drugs that increase the production of proteins that help build muscle. Anabolic steroids, often called anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), can be taken orally in the form of pills or as an injection. The most commonly used anabolic steroid in sports is testosterone (androgen), which is usually injected. Other anabolic steroids are deca-durabolin, stanozolol, and oxandrolone.\nAlthough steroids are effective for treating a variety of conditions, they are also highly abused. Steroids are very powerful drugs that can increase the strength and size of muscles while also increasing the activity of hormones in the body that promote weight gain and decrease the activity of hormones that promote fat loss.\nFor example, steroids can help increase the amount of protein that is broken down in the body, which can lead to an increase in muscle protein synthesis. This is known as protein synthesis, and it is the rate at which the body breaks down and builds up new muscle tissue.\nWhile steroids are generally used to treat a variety of medical conditions, they are also frequently abused because they can also improve athletic performance. Anabolic steroids can increase strength, increase the size of muscles, and promote weight gain. This can help athletes improve their physical abilities, and steroids have been used for this purpose in sports since the 1960s.\nHowever, the use of steroids has long been controversial in professional and college sports. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, steroids were extensively used by professional baseball players as a way to increase strength and speed, and by NFL players to improve performance. Steroid use increased in the 1980s and 1990s, and many professional athletes admitted to using steroids.\nIn 1997, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was founded as a way to help regulate drug use in professional and collegiate sports. The agency began working to create a list of banned substances in sports, and steroids were added to the list in 2001.\nSince then, the use of steroids in sports has been banned across the world, including in the United States. The use of steroids in sports has also been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\nAlthough steroids are banned in sports, they are still used by athletes who want to improve their performance or who are dealing with medical conditions. However, while steroids can help treat conditions like asthma and arthritis, it is important to understand that steroids can cause serious side effects in certain patients.\nBecause steroids are banned in sports, athletes who want to use steroids must either find a doctor who will provide them with a prescription for the drugs, or they can purchase them online.\nVisit INSIDER’s homepage for more."

Prompt: 'What is HIV?\n' 
Generated text: '\nHIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that attacks the immune system. It has an envelope around it that is so tough that it is impossible to break through. The virus attacks white blood cells, and can cause diseases such as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and lymphoma. Once it is in the bloodstream, it may spread to the nervous system, brain, liver and spleen.\n\nPeople who have AIDS have many illnesses due to the virus. Some of the most common symptoms are weight loss, fever, sores in the mouth and throat, stomach pain, and weakness. With HIV, there is a strong possibility that the immune system will begin to fail, and the person may have a high risk of developing tuberculosis, hepatitis, pneumonia, and cancer.\n\nHIV can be transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk and saliva. Transmission can occur if an infected person does not know that he or she is infected.\n\nHIV cannot be spread through casual contact. In order to transmit HIV, a person must have a break in their immune system. It is important to note that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. AIDS is caused by the body\'s immune system becoming weak and unable to fight off a wide variety of infections.\n\nPeople can be infected with HIV if they have sex with someone who is infected with the virus. This is known as "contact" transmission. The virus can also be transmitted if someone has sex with an infected mother and her child is born with HIV.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?\n\nSome of the first symptoms of HIV are flu-like, and include fever, chills, sore throat, and muscle aches. Other symptoms may include loss of appetite, headaches, and weight loss. When HIV is being transmitted, the virus may begin to alter the appearance of the skin. The lips may become blistered or broken, and the skin may become dry or discolored. The HIV-infected person may also begin to show signs of HIV-related illnesses, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.\n\nHow is HIV treated?\n\nThere are many different kinds of treatments for HIV. Doctors will determine the best treatment for the infected person based on his or her symptoms, previous treatments, and health history.\n\nHIV medications may be taken to treat symptoms and to reduce the chances of HIV being transmitted. These medications may be taken by mouth, intravenously (into a vein) or by injection (into the muscle).\n\nFor people who have HIV but do not have symptoms, some of the medications that may be taken include antiviral drugs, AIDS-defining antiretroviral drugs, antifungal drugs, and antidiabetic drugs.\n\nFor people who have HIV, but are not showing any symptoms, some of the medications that may be taken include antiviral drugs and antifungal drugs.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for people with HIV?\n\nThe prognosis for people with HIV depends on the person\'s age, health, and previous illnesses. Generally speaking, people who are HIV-positive may have a long life expectancy if they receive the proper treatment. However, if the immune system is severely weakened, or if the person has other illnesses, the life expectancy may be much shorter.\n\nWhat are the causes of HIV?\n\nHIV is caused by a virus. The virus is called HIV-1, and the virus is spread through sexual contact, blood transfusion, drug injection, and mother to child transmission. People may become infected with the virus through heterosexual contact.\n\nCan HIV be cured?\n\nThere is no cure for HIV, but many people do live long and healthy lives with the proper treatment. In order to cure HIV, the immune system must be strengthened.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent HIV?\n\nThe best way to prevent HIV is to use protection when having sex or using drugs. Safe sex practices include using a condom for all sexual contact.\n\nA safe drug use practice would include using a new needle for every injection or use. HIV-infected people should not share needles, syringes, or other injectable drugs.\n\nFor people who have HIV, safe drug use practices include getting tested for HIV before injecting drugs. It is very important to keep drugs separate from one another and to clean and sterilize one\'s equipment.\n\nIs there any way to prevent HIV?\n\nThere is no vaccine for HIV. However, there are a few things that can be done to reduce the chances of catching HIV.\n\nFirst, it is important to use a condom during sex. Using condoms can reduce the chances of spreading HIV.\n\nSecond, it is important to stay away from people who are infected with HIV.\n\nThird, it is important to get tested for HIV every year.\n\nFourth, it is important to use safer sex'

Prompt: 'What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMS symptoms can appear suddenly or gradually, as in progressive MS. The most common symptoms of MS are:\n\nVision problems, including blurriness or loss of vision in one or both eyes, double vision or a feeling of being "tunnel-visioned".\n\nTingling, numbness or pain in the hands, legs or feet.\n\nBalance problems that make it difficult to walk, stand or balance.\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?\n\nA neurologist will review your symptoms and perform a physical exam. He or she will also order blood tests and other tests, including:\n\nBlood tests to measure levels of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, or ANCA. If these levels are high, they may indicate that you have autoimmune disease.\n\nCT scan to see if the brain has lesions.\n\nMRI scan of the brain to look for lesions.\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis treated?\n\nTreatment varies depending on the severity of your symptoms. Some people take drugs, such as beta interferon or interleukin-2, to treat symptoms. Others may need to take medication for the rest of their lives.\n\nSome people have other treatments, including:\n\nMuscle-relaxing drugs\n\nPhysical therapy to increase flexibility and strength\n\nNerve damage treatment, including spinal cord stimulation or deep brain stimulation\n\nStem cell transplants are sometimes used to treat MS.\n\nWhat are the risks of multiple sclerosis?\n\nMultiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disease of young adults in the United States. Although it is more common in women, it can affect men as well. The risk of developing MS increases as people age.\n\nRisk factors for multiple sclerosis include:\n\nFamily history.\n\nWomen who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\nSmoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke.\n\nHaving an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHaving the disease-causing gene called the B-cell lymphoma 2 gene.\n\nWhat is the prognosis of multiple sclerosis?\n\nThe overall prognosis for people with MS depends on the severity and location of the disease.\n\nMS symptoms can worsen and become more severe over time. As the disease progresses, your brain can become more sensitive to light, causing you to have headaches, blurred vision, dizziness or double vision. The progression of MS can also cause severe disability, particularly if the disease affects the brain.\n\nIf your symptoms are mild, you may be able to live a full and active life, although you may need some physical therapy to help you stay mobile and flexible. You may need to learn to live with the effects of MS, such as walking with a cane or sitting in a wheelchair.\n\nIf the disease affects your brain, you may develop progressive MS. This type of MS can result in worsening disability and paralysis, and may lead to death.\n\nProgression of multiple sclerosis can be slowed or stopped through medication. If you continue to take your medications, your symptoms may improve.\n\nIf you have relapsing-remitting MS, your symptoms can get better over time, or get worse, or stay the same. The course of your disease depends on the severity of your symptoms.\n\nIn contrast, if you have primary progressive MS, the disease worsens over time.\n\nWhat are the complications of multiple sclerosis?\n\nComplications of MS include:\n\nNeurological damage.\n\nVisual problems, including blindness.\n\nUncontrolled pain.\n\nHow can multiple sclerosis be prevented?\n\nIn the past, researchers thought the best way to prevent multiple sclerosis was to avoid exposure to certain viruses, such as rubella and measles. However, research has shown that these viruses do not cause the disease.\n\nExperts still believe that multiple sclerosis is caused by an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, but researchers have not yet determined what causes these conditions.\n\nThere is no way to prevent MS. However, a healthy lifestyle may lower your risk of MS. A healthy diet and lifestyle can lower your risk of developing other health problems, too.'

Prompt: 'What causes multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and is caused by a previously unidentified autoimmune disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). It has three types of symptoms: relapsing, remitting, and progressive forms. Relapsing forms are the most common type and can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary relapsing forms of MS are initially diagnosed before a person reaches 40 years of age, while secondary relapsing forms are more common in older patients.\n\nThe majority of patients will have two or more relapses in their life time, which can range from one to five. A relapse is a temporary worsening of symptoms that occurs after a remission. There are two types of remitting forms of MS: primary and secondary. Primary remitting forms can be either primary or secondary. Secondary forms of MS are more likely to progress into secondary progressive forms of MS.\n\nThe progressive forms of MS are most common in women and people who are under age 40. The progressive forms of MS can cause gradual loss of cognitive function and can also lead to paralysis. The causes of progressive forms are unknown, although smoking, family history of multiple sclerosis, and exposure to environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation have been associated with the disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis can also develop as a result of spinal cord injury. It can also occur as a result of stroke or trauma.\n\nIf multiple sclerosis occurs in the brain, it is known as brain-specific MS (BSMS). If it occurs in the spinal cord, it is known as spinal cord-specific MS (SCMS). If both brain and spinal cord are affected, it is called mixed-type MS.\n\nMost of the time, multiple sclerosis is diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. The early stages of MS occur when the person has one to three relapses. It can take up to seven years for the disease to progress from the early to the middle stages.\n\nIn the middle stages of MS, the disease will progress to the severe form of MS. In the severe form, the person will have at least two relapses and there will be cognitive impairment. In the final stages of MS, the person will lose the ability to walk and function as well as having total loss of vision.\n\nIf you suspect that you may have multiple sclerosis, you should speak with a qualified healthcare professional as early as possible. The earlier that multiple sclerosis is diagnosed, the better the chances of treatment, slowing or preventing the progression of the disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord.

Prompt: 'How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?\n' 
Generated text: "\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nMultiple sclerosis is diagnosed based on symptoms and results from a physical examination. The doctor will ask the patient about their symptoms and may order a physical exam to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nThe doctor will first rule out other causes of the symptoms by evaluating the patient's blood and urine for abnormalities. The blood may be checked for immune system abnormalities, and the urine will be tested for genetic disorders. The doctor may perform a neurological exam, which involves checking the patient's reflexes and testing their coordination.\n\nThe doctor will typically diagnose multiple sclerosis based on a combination of the patient's medical history, clinical symptoms and neurological exam results. In addition, the doctor will check for other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as an autoimmune condition.\n\nThe doctor will provide the patient with information about the cause of multiple sclerosis, including risk factors and ways to prevent the condition. The patient may be advised to take certain medications, such as beta-blockers, to control their symptoms and prevent future attacks."

Prompt: 'What are the types of multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThere are more than 20 different types of multiple sclerosis. Each type of multiple sclerosis is caused by a different type of immune system malfunction.\n\nDoctors call the different types of multiple sclerosis "types" because they are affected by different parts of the immune system.\n\nThe types of multiple sclerosis are classified by the type of immune system malfunction that creates the disease. For example, one type of multiple sclerosis may be caused by a problem with T cells, another type by problems with B cells.\n\nMultiple sclerosis can\'t be cured, but it can be managed. Your doctor will help you to develop a treatment plan that works best for you.\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor may order tests to diagnose multiple sclerosis. These tests include:\n\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain\n\nMRI of the spinal cord\n\nSpirometry (measuring the function of the lungs)\n\nLumbar puncture (drilling a hole in your lower back to put a small sample of spinal fluid into a test tube for analysis)\n\nBlood tests to check your blood count, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function\n\nHow is multiple sclerosis treated?\n\nYour doctor will help you develop a treatment plan that works best for you. Some treatments are available for most types of multiple sclerosis.\n\nTreatment can help reduce the effects of the disease and slow the progression of disability. It\'s important to work closely with your doctor to find the best treatment for your type of multiple sclerosis.\n\nYour doctor may recommend the following treatment options for most types of multiple sclerosis:\n\nMedicines. Medicines may be recommended for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. These medicines can improve symptoms and slow the progression of disability.\n\nMedicines are usually given in the form of injections, pills, or tablets. Some medicines can cause side effects that are serious or life-threatening.\n\nSupport groups. Support groups can help you feel less alone during your illness.\n\nPilates. A study found that Pilates can improve the balance and strength of people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nPilates involves a series of postures, which are repeated to strengthen muscles and improve flexibility. It may be helpful for people with multiple sclerosis to learn Pilates.\n\nWhat is my outlook?\n\nMost people with multiple sclerosis live a normal life span. However, some people with multiple sclerosis may have a worse prognosis than others.\n\nRevision Information\n\nThis content is reviewed regularly and is updated when new and relevant evidence is made available.

Prompt: 'What treatments exist for multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMS is a chronic disease that attacks the nervous system in the brain and spinal cord. The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The disease affects the signals that travel along the nervous system.\n\nThe main treatments are drugs that slow the progression of the disease.\n\nOne drug called interferon beta (IFN-beta) is used for relapsing-remitting MS. It slows down the disease and lessens symptoms.\n\nIf the disease progresses, the drug is not effective. Another drug called glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is used to slow down the progression of the disease and reduce symptoms. Glatiramer acetate is injected into the body once every four weeks.\n\nIf the disease progresses, it is very hard to treat. The body’s immune system attacks the nerves. There are no good treatments that can help the nerves.\n\nHow is MS diagnosed?\n\nThe cause of MS is unknown.\n\nMS is diagnosed based on the symptoms. Most people with MS have at least one symptom. The most common symptoms are numbness or tingling in one or more parts of the body. They may also experience muscle spasms or tremors.\n\nThese symptoms can appear and disappear. There is no way to predict which symptoms will appear and when.\n\nThe symptoms depend on where the damage occurs in the nervous system.\n\nHow is MS treated?\n\nThere are no drugs that can help the nerves. The treatment is based on the symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms are treated with two types of drugs.\n\nOne drug is called interferon beta. It is given every four weeks.\n\nThe other drug is called glatiramer acetate. It is injected into the body once every four weeks.\n\nThe medications work in different ways. Glatiramer acetate blocks the nerves from producing inflammatory proteins that attack the nerves.\n\nInterferon beta makes the immune system attack the nerves. It helps reduce symptoms by slowing the progression of the disease.\n\nWhat is the outlook?\n\nThe outlook depends on how the disease progresses.\n\nThe disease is unpredictable. It can progress in many different ways. It can also return after the treatment has stopped.\n\nPeople with relapsing-remitting MS typically have a good quality of life. They may have a disability but it is not as severe as when the disease is active.\n\nSome people with active MS will be able to control the disease. They will have a good quality of life.\n\nOthers will have a progressive form of MS. They will lose the ability to walk. They may lose the ability to speak.\n\nMost people with progressive MS will die of the disease.\n\nPeople with progressive MS live for an average of 20 years after the first symptoms.'

Prompt: 'What are the disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis are interferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, glatiramer acetate and leflunomide. The disease-modifying therapies are given either in tablet form or in intravenous form.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nThe disease-modifying therapies are administered to reduce the number of new lesions and the number of relapses. The disease-modifying therapies are given to patients who have not responded well to other treatments and who have relapses of their multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe disease-modifying therapies are sometimes used to treat patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The disease-modifying therapies are sometimes used to treat patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis, though this use is not recommended.'

Prompt: 'What is the life expectancy for people with multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: "\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe life expectancy for people with multiple sclerosis ranges from between 20 to 50 years, with the majority of patients living between 30 to 35 years. The disease, which can develop at any age, is characterized by the abnormal formation of myelin, the fatty insulating sheath that surrounds nerve cells.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nThe exact cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but scientists have found that the disease occurs when a person's immune system attacks the myelin sheath. People with multiple sclerosis are at a higher risk for infection and various cancers, and they are also more prone to injury. Multiple sclerosis is the most common chronic autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system attacks healthy cells."

Generated text: 'Le système d\'hypertension artérielle (SHy) est une forme de hypertension, et elle touche plus de 10% des personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus. Cette forme de hypertension développe lorsque l\'articulation d\'artères et de tube se dégrade. C\'est l\'articulation de tube qui se dégrade, ce qui change la forme du système de circulation des féculons et ne le permet pas de corriger le système.\nL\'articulation de tube est la partie du tube qui entoure la bouche d\'un féculon et qui permet d\'élever l\'articulation de l\'artère sur le tube. Elle s\'appelle le "tube de l\'articulation de tube". La dégradation du tube de l\'articulation de tube, ce qui s\'appelle le "tube de l\'articulation de tube dégradé" (titanium), peut entraîner des symptômes, y compris la hausse de la pression arterielle, l\'hypertension artérielle.\nCette forme de hypertension peut également dégénérer et conduire à un mal de voie cardiaque. Les symptômes des premières formes d\'hypertension artérielle sont souvent similaires à celles du syndrome de la douleur cardiaque, et certains sont aussi similaires à ceux de l\'hypertension de douleur.\nLa forme de hypertension artérielle est différente de l\'hypertension sévère et grave, et celle-ci touche moins de 10% des personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus. L\'hypertension artérielle touche plus de 10% de la population, mais les personnes âgées des 65 ans et plus, le plus touchées, sont 8,5%.\nLa maladie est sous-diagnostiquée. C\'est pourquoi les patients souffrent de symptômes nouveaux pendant de longues périodes. La maladie peut être étiquetée par l\'hypertension artérielle à l\'hypertension sévère et grave. C\'est une épilepsie cardiaque, une forme de cardiopatie artérielle, un fait plus grave que l\'hypertension artérielle, car l\'hypertension sévère et grave entraîne plusieurs symptômes, y compris le stress cardiaque, la dégénérescence cardiaque et la résistance cardiaque.\nMalgré l\'accès de nombreux traitements à la maladie, l\'articulation de tube de l\'articulation de tube dégradé peut nécessiter des traitements d\'urgence. Lorsque l\'articulation de tube dégrade, le tube de l\'articulation de tube peut s\'éloigner de son cadre normal, et ça peut entraîner une rupture et un délai pour rétablir le système.\nLes traitements différents des symptômes, y compris les traitements médicaux et non médicaux, sont utilisés pour améliorer la santé de la personne concernée. Ces traitements peuvent inclure des traitements médicaux, mais aussi des traitements non médicaux. Le traitement non médicaux inclut des traitements médicaux, mais aussi des traitements non médicaux.\nLes traitements médicaux peuvent inclure de nombreux traitements, par exemple, la thérapie, un médicament, un thérapien, un médecin, un suivi, un traitement, un traitement non médicaux, un traitement médical, un traitement non médicaux, un traitement médical non médical, un traitement médical non médical, un traitement médical non médical, une thérapie, un médicament, un m'

Cette question a été posée au sein de l'équipe d'épidémiologistes de l'ARS de Montpellier, qui a pour mission de s'en servir en cas d'épidémie pour étudier les problèmes de santé publique.\nLes risques de l'hypertension artérielle sont liés aux facteurs de risque associés aux caractéristiques de l'hypertension en général, comme son duration, ses causes, sa course, ses effets secondaires et sa progression. Ces risques sont quant à eux nombreux pour toutes les personnes à risque. Ces risques peuvent déjà être pris en compte par des praticiens de la santé, qui s'adressent à leurs patients ainsi que par des études cliniques.\nLa pandémie de COVID-19 a été associée à la progression de l'hypertension artérielle, car l'hypertension peut être un facteur de risque de décès en raison de la surcharge cardiaque.\nL'hypertension artérielle est aussi associée aux troubles cardiovasculaires, comme l'arrêt cardiaque.

Prompt: "Quand faut-il prendre des médicaments pour l'hypertension artérielle ?\n" 
Generated text: "\nPar : Dr. Massimiliano Latorre\n\nL'hypertension artérielle est un phénomène qui croît très vite. Elle est principalement liée à une expérience extrême de stress, et avec cette expérience, il s'avère que la pression arterielle augmente.\n\nCette pathologie est très fréquente chez les travailleurs en activité, mais aussi chez les adultes dans leur vie quotidienne. Elle est répandue dans les pays où les activités physiques sont moins élevées.\n\nAujourd'hui, la plupart des adultes ne prennent pas d'antidépresseurs, car ils pensent que cela ne lui aide pas. Cependant, ces médicaments sont aussi utiles pour réduire les risques de décès liés à la hypertension artérielle. Il est important de prendre du temps pour comprendre les différents médicaments. Par exemple, la cléprise des tests légers ne semble pas être efficace pour les patients à risques de décès. Le médicament n'est pas seulement utilisé pour réduire la pression arterielle, il peut également être utilisé pour lutter contre les déficiences cardiovasculaires. La plupart de ces médicaments ne sont pas obligatoires.\n\nPourquoi prendre des médicaments à base de cléisation ?\n\nIl existe beaucoup de médicaments à base de cléisation, mais il n'est pas nécessaire de le prendre. Les médicaments à base de cléisation sont plus efficaces pour les patients à risques de décès. Cela devrait être le cas parce qu'il existe beaucoup de risques liés à la hypertension artérielle. Ainsi, si vous prenez un médicament à base de cléisation, vous aurez un meilleur résultat. Il peut aussi être très efficace pour réduire les risques de décès liés à la cardiosequence.\n\nCela fait 15 ans que j'ai commencé à travailler avec des médicaments à base de cléisation. Aujourd'hui, je pratique avec des patients qui ont souffert de la cardiosequence, qui ne vont plus voir le médecin.\n\nPar contre, on ne doit pas prendre des médicaments à base de cléisation pour tout le monde. D'abord, vous avez besoin d'une clinique qui vous fait des tests. Par exemple, une clinique de l'Ouest américain a développé une équipe qui teste les médicaments qui ont un impact sur la pression arterielle. D'ailleurs, il y a un médicament à base de cléisation qui permet de diminuer les risques de décès, mais ce médicament est relativement dangereux. La clinique doit tester les médicaments à base de cléisation et vous donner un médicament qui est efficace et qui ne pose pas de risques.\n\nCe médicament n'est pas seulement utilisé pour lutter contre la cardiosequence. Il peut également être utilisé pour réduire les risques de décès liés à la hypertension artérielle.\n\nLa cléprise des tests peut être utilisée ?\n\nParfois, la cléprise des tests est utile pour les patients qui souffrent de la cardiosequence, mais il faut être certain que le médicament en question réduit la pression arterielle.

Prompt: "Qu'est-ce que les stéroïdes?\n" 
Generated text: '\nLes stéroïdes sont des hormones générées par la circulation sanguine, et produites par des cellules qui présentent des différences de shape et de forme. Dans un cas particulier, ils se produisent par la fibrose pulmonaire. L\'enjeu de la santé est donc de trouver des antidépresseurs contre ce type de fibrose pulmonaire.\n\nSelon le Dr Errol Flynn, le Dr George Pappas et le Dr Richard Cade, une association de médecins à l\'époque, "les stéroïdes sont des hormones qui provoquent la dépression et la fièvre, et peuvent conduire à des troubles psychiatriques. Cela dit, la réponse à cette évolution des sciences s\'est donc mise sur la dépression et la fièvre, et les stéroïdes comme antidépresseurs n\'ont pas été recherchés. Mais il a été démontré que, dans une situation de stress, les stéroïdes peuvent aussi contribuer à une augmentation du risque de dépression et de fièvre chez les personnes qui en ont besoin. Par exemple, ils augmentent le risque de dépression chez des patientes atteintes de fibrose pulmonaire."\n\nLe Dr Flynn, qui était un des personnages les plus connus de l\'émission "Spirou et Fantasio", explique par exemple que ces stéroïdes produisent des hormones nocives à l\'estomac, dont le cortisol. Il est donc important de limiter ces stéroïdes dans notre vie quotidienne.\n\n"L\'hypothèse actuelle, c\'est que les stéroïdes sont responsables de l\'anxiété"\n\n– Dr Errol Flynn\n\n"Les stéroïdes sont responsables de l\'anxiété", commente le Dr Flynn, "même s\'il n\'y a pas encore de preuve concrète que ce sont les stéroïdes qui causent l\'anxiété. Mais l\'hypothèse actuelle, c\'est que les stéroïdes sont responsables de l\'anxiété. C\'est ce que le Dr Flynn souligne par exemple dans une étude publiée dans le Journal of the American Medical Association en 2010, et qui a été retransmise en France par l\'émission "Télévision de France 2" cette semaine.\n\n"L\'hypothèse actuelle, c\'est que les stéroïdes sont responsables de l\'anxiété"\n\n– Dr Errol Flynn\n\nL\'étude met en avant deux autres indications. "D\'abord, ils peuvent contribuer à l\'augmentation du risque de dépression chez les personnes qui en ont besoin, comme on l\'a vu. D\'autre part, ils peuvent aussi contribuer à l\'augmentation du risque de dépression chez les patientes présentant une fibrose pulmonaire. En outre, ils peuvent contribuer à l\'augmentation de la pression sanguine chez les personnes déjà déprimées parce qu\'elles ont une fibrose pulmonaire, ce qui est un facteur majeur dans l\'augmentation de la pression sanguine."\n\nLe Dr Flynn n\'a pas non plus eu l\'occasion de poursuivre ces remarques lors d\'une discussion publique à l\'occasion de sa publication dans l\'étude, mais cela ne l\'empêche pas d\'annoncer que les antidépresseurs actuellement utilisés pour la fibrose pulmonaire sont contre-productifs pour l\'anticorps, ce qui explique pourquoi la probité des antidépresseurs actuellement en circulation s\'est vite écrasée.\n\n"L\'anticorps est un médicament pour le dépression"\n\n– Dr Errol Flynn\n\n"Les antidépresseurs act'

Generated text: "\nLes stéroïdes, soit les stéroïdes actifs, soit les stéroïdes inactivés, sont des molécules chimiques, identifiées par leur caractère de structure chimique. Les stéroïdes actifs sont classées en trois catégories (« A », « B » et « C »). La catégorie « A » comprend les stéroïdes produits par les océans, ceux produits par les plantes et ceux produits par les végétaux. Les stéroïdes « B » sont les stéroïdes qui se trouvent dans les plantes, et les stéroïdes « C » sont les stéroïdes qui se trouvent dans les végétaux. Les stéroïdes « A » sont les plus souvent utilisés pour traiter des maladies qui ont un impact sur la santé humaine. C'est notamment le cas pour la maladie de Parkinson et la maladie de dépression. La maladie de dépression, soit le syndrome du dépressionnisme, est une maladie qui affecte la dépression, une psychose ou une manque d'estime. C'est aussi le cas pour certaines maladies chroniques comme le cancer ou le syndrome de l'osteomédecine. Les stéroïdes « B » sont aussi utilisés pour traiter des maladies qui sont liées à la métabolisation de la mémoire. Le processus de mémoire, c'est-à-dire la mémoire des organes du corps, s'intensifie chez des personnes qui pratiquent le sport, ce qui permet de traiter des maladies qui étaient très fréquentes avant leur traitement par les stéroïdes « B ». Les stéroïdes « C » sont utilisés pour traiter des maladies chroniques, comme la tuberculose et le cancer. Les stéroïdes « C » sont aussi utilisés pour éviter des maladies chroniques, comme le cancer.\n\nPar exemple, le stéroïde « E » est utilisé pour traiter des maladies chroniques comme la tuberculose ou la tuberculose sévère. Le stéroïde « F » est utilisé pour traiter des maladies chroniques comme la tuberculose ou la tuberculose sévère.

Ces substances ont été décrites par le pouvoir légal comme étant des neurotoxines, un vrai souci en France. Cependant, le nombre de rapports qui ont été publiés sur le sujet de manière détaillée et dont les résultats ont été confirmés par de nouveaux travaux parlementaires, a été considérable. Il existe plusieurs types de stéroïdes, dont les ne sont pas décrits comme neurotoxiques par le pouvoir légal.\n\nLe sujet du neurotoxisme a été débattu pendant des années et il a été conclu que de nombreux stéroïdes peuvent avoir des effets secondaires qu'il est difficile de déterminer.

Ces comprimés sont utilisés pour améliorer la santé du gout. Le pralocitin peut aussi être utilisé pour traiter des conditions métaboliques.\n\nEn outre, le traitement de prévention a été développé depuis plusieurs années pour la prise d'antibiotiques. La prévention préférée est d'être préparée à l'antibiotique lorsque le diagnostic est faite, mais la prévention de ces stéroïdes peut avoir des effets secondaires. Il existe plusieurs études qui montrent qu'au cours de la prévention, il y a peu de bénéfices, mais des effets secondaires. Il est difficile d'établir des statistiques.\n\nDes effets secondaires du stéroïde de l'estratège\n\nLe stéroïde de l'estratège est un traitement antibiotique qui se pratique dans des poubelles et qui est utilisé pour traiter des infections.

C\'est l\'objet de cette question.\n\nLES STÉROïDES NEURALES VEUX SUR LA PILOTE\n\nDans un article publié dans le New England Journal of Medicine en avril, le professeur de médecine américain Jeffrey S. Miller, à l\'Université d\'Alaska, évoque ces stéroïdes qui se sont développés en pharmacie, pour atteindre des étapes clés de leur mise sur le marché.\n\n"Nos travaux suggèrent que les stéroïdes neuromodulators (STN) permettent la rééducation de la qualité de la vie quotidienne en réduisant la douleur et la stérilité post-traumatique" à des niveaux "comparables à ceux de patients qui ont fait l\'objet d\'une chirurgie chirurgicale", écrit le chercheur.\n\n"Au-delà des recherches cliniques, il est important de préciser que les STN sont des substances dont le contenu est nécessairement préoccupant.

Ils ont fait une analyse de l'ovine pour voir si ce ne sont pas des virus à partir du VIH, mais ils ont conclu qu'il n'y avait pas de virus. J'avais un examen de sang, et j'ai vu que j'étais infectée. Je me suis dit que c'était une erreur, puis je me suis dit que ce n'était pas une erreur. Il y a eu des tests plus tard, mais nous n'avons pas obtenu d'explication.

Generated text: "Le VIH est-il curable? Il y a beaucoup de questions qui tordent la bouche des personnes souffrant de la maladie du VIH/Sida, notamment les cas sur leur détermination à faire face à ce virus.\nEn effet, la maladie est-elle curable? C'est un vrai dessein posé aux hommes, souvent et sans doute, mais l'idée de leur faire mourir en voulant laisser de côté la possibilité d'une certaine résistance à la maladie n'est pas encore légitime.\nComment peut-on détecter le virus?\nPour de plus en plus de personnes, la maladie du VIH est définitivement diagnostiquée sur le bas du visage. Une simple prise d'appel à l'urgence du patient pourrait également être suffisante pour établir les diagnostics.\nSi l'on veut bien faire face à la maladie, il faudra sans doute exiger de l'utilisation de prélèvements sanguins en laboratoire et de tests réguliers. Ces diagnostics prendront des temps, et il y a des risques de retards, de maladie et de décès.\nAvant de passer à l'étape suivante, il faut aussi traiter les cas au plus vite et de façon préventive. Dans cette optique, il s'agira de réduire les risques d'infection dans les centres d'hébergement.\nQui peut vivre avec le VIH?\nLe VIH peut être transmis à l'autre ou à des adultes et à des enfants. L'un ou l'autre peut être affecté par le virus, ou encore ceux-ci peuvent être trompés.\nSi on ajoute à cela le fait que le VIH peut également être transmis d'enfant à enfant ou d'adulte à adulte, on peut comprendre que le virus constitue un danger pour le système de santé.\nLe VIH est d'autant plus difficile à diagnostiquer que les cas graves sont souvent occultés.\nAlors, comment peut-on identifier ces cas graves? D'abord parce qu'il est important de rappeler que les symptômes de la maladie sont essentiellement similaires à ceux des maux de tête.\nL'infection du VIH peut s'avérer difficile à diagnostiquer. En effet, de plus en plus de cas graves sont obscurs.\nLes cas graves sont un peu moins souvent identifiés que les cas simples. Et les symptômes sont un peu différents. Pour ce faire, il faudra établir un diagnostic rapide et d'une qualité.\nUne fois que la maladie du VIH est diagnostiquée, on va considérer une fois de plus les personnes souffrantes. Si la maladie est à un stade extrêmement grave, alors les personnes souffrantes seront diagnostiquées.\nCela signifie que les personnes dans lesquelles la maladie du VIH est diagnostiquée sont peut-être très fréquemment soignées.\nEn revanche, il y a beaucoup de cas de VIH qui ne sont pas diagnostiqués. Les personnes qui sont souffrantes d'une infection du VIH sont très souvent évacuées de la région. Les cas graves sont isolés, car ils sont peu nombreux.\nPour les cas graves, il s'agit de lancer l'alerte et de faire appel aux services d'urgence. Et pour les cas simples, il faudra d'abord s'assurer que tout est dit.\nQu'est-ce qui fait l'attention de la maladie du VIH?\nLe VIH est une maladie rare. Mais,"

Generated text: 'Lorsque le VIH est détecté chez un fœtus, les médecins l\'obtiennent quelques jours après l\'injection de la première dose de spermine, quelques jours après l\'injection de l\'équivalent d\'une semaine de désinfectante par action. Lorsque le virus est encore moins commun, il est également possible de faire vacciner une mère contre le VIH.\nEst-ce qu\'il est vraiment le cas pour les infections transmises de la mère à l\'enfant?\nPar Ambre BENSACHE\nSelon les experts, le VIH est parfois transmis de la mère à l\'enfant. Les réponses sont alors différentes pour l\'une de ces transmission. "La transmission de la mère à l\'enfant peut se faire via le bébé ou un cadavre, comme en cas de maladie cérébrale", ajoute Madeleine. L\'avantage d\'un vaccin contre le VIH, c\'est qu\'il est injecté dans le dos, ce qui rend l\'apparition d\'une trace médicale plus fréquente.\n"La transmission du VIH de la mère à l\'enfant peut se faire par la présence de la mère dans le quartier et par l\'enfant dans des enfants de mère avec un système immunitaire défaillant. Ce qui est plus problématique pour l\'enfant, c\'est la présence de la mère dans un quartier déséquilibré ou dans un environnement où la mère n\'a pas de soins ou d\'activités, et est donc dans une situation difficile de vie. Cela peut permettre l\'exposition à la maladie", soutient Madeleine.\nMais pour avoir une contamination du VIH, il faut qu\'une personne, mère ou fille, soit contaminée par une personne déjà contaminée. Ainsi, si une personne fait le lit avec leur petit-fils, il est possible de transmission du VIH.\nSurtout, le développement de l\'injection de la première dose de spermine a amené le VIH à se développer en couches. "Les enfants qui étaient dans une situation de stress ou de difficultés dans les quartiers ont souvent été exposés à un virus dans l\'air par leur mère. Aujourd\'hui, ceux qui sont nés à l\'hôpital, malades, également, sont les plus exposés aux bébés à la dépression", explique Madeleine.\nCela souligne la nécessité de respecter les consignes médicales dans tous les quartiers, pour éviter que les enfants nés à l\'hôpital ne soient exposés à la transmission du VIH.\n"La transmission de la mère à l\'enfant peut se faire mais l\'évolution du virus pourrait être différente pour les deux sexes. Les bébés sont souvent dans des situations difficiles avec les mères et que ce soit avec leur mère ou avec une autre personne qui va leur faire des affaires", souligne Madeleine.'

Il s'agit donc d'une forme de sclérose dont les symptômes sont graves et qui peut avoir des conséquences graves sur le système digestif et l'apport. C'est également une sclérose des cerveaux qui peut entraîner des troubles psychiques graves.\nQui sont les plus vulnérables?\nLes plus vulnérables sont les enfants, les femmes, les femmes âgées et les personnes âgées. Les médecins pourraient donc considérer que leur application de cette molécule a plus de chances de se révéler efficace.\nLes termes du contrat\nEn l'état actuel de l'épidémie, on ne sait pas encore si le Remdesivir sera utilisé pour tout le monde. En tout cas, les termes du contrat n'indiquent pas que le remdesivir sera disponible à tous les patients. Il reste que ce n'est pas nécessairement le cas."

Les sclérose en plaques sont des maladies de la circulation sanguine, et elles peuvent entraîner la mort lorsqu'elles sont pas traitées. À l'échelle mondiale, elles sont de plus en plus fréquentes et viennent d'augmenter de manière alarmante. De plus en plus d'êtres humains sont touchés, notamment les femmes.\nL'exercice de boxe est une activité qui utilise beaucoup de mouvement et de force. De ce fait, il semble bien que cette activité ne soit pas si utile pour les sclérose en plaques que pour les autres types de maladies. Les chercheurs ont découvert que l'exercice de boxe pourrait survenir à des sclérose en plaques. Cela signifie que les sclérose en plaques peuvent être mortelles.\nCependant, les chercheurs n'ont pas pu conclure que l'exercice de boxe est la cause des sclérose en plaques. Cela est peut-être le cas, mais il est difficile de le savoir. En effet, il n'existe pas de test qui permette de conclure que l'exercice de boxe est la cause.\nPour comprendre cette nouvelle, il est important de saisir le fait que les sclérose en plaques sont parfois traitées et que cela a des effets sur l'apparition de ces maladies.\nPlus on examine les effets des traitements, plus on va comprendre l'importance de la médecine et de l'éducation.\nPour conclure, les chercheurs ont dû faire un travail compliqué pour les étudier.

Generated text: '\nHigh blood pressure is the medical term for a condition called hypertension (HTN). High blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries when the heart is pumping. The force of blood pressure increases when the heart is pumping harder, such as during exercise. Over time, the pressure can damage the heart.\n\nThe force of blood pressure increases when the heart is pumping harder, such as during exercise. Over time, the pressure can damage the heart.\n\nHow is it measured?\n\nThe most accurate way to measure blood pressure is through a blood pressure cuff. You may be able to get a blood pressure reading from a device that requires you to hold your arm outstretched and measure it with your fingertip, but it is not as accurate as a cuff. A cuff is attached to a machine that measures the blood pressure.\n\nWhat is high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure occurs when the force of the blood pushing against the walls of the arteries is higher than normal. The blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The higher the reading, the higher the blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\n\nIf you have high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. That’s because it is common for people with high blood pressure to not realize they have it. When high blood pressure is diagnosed early, treatment can help prevent complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nHigh blood pressure is also known as "the silent killer," because it often goes unnoticed until it has damaged the heart.\n\nHigh blood pressure can be diagnosed through a blood pressure reading using a cuff on the arm, or through a device that measures it with the fingertip.\n\nHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?\n\nIf you have high blood pressure and are at risk for heart disease, your doctor may order several blood tests to determine the diagnosis. These blood tests include:\n\nblood pressure readings\n\na complete blood count (CBC)\n\na kidney function test\n\na heart exam\n\nSome of the signs that high blood pressure is present include:\n\ntrouble breathing\n\ndizziness\n\nfainting\n\nheadaches\n\nvision problems\n\nloss of coordination\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, talk with your doctor about what may be causing them.\n\nHow is high blood pressure treated?\n\nHigh blood pressure can be treated with medication. If you are at high risk for heart disease, you may also be given a heart monitor to check your heart rhythm and blood pressure, which may help guide your treatment.\n\nWhat is a medication?\n\nA medication is a chemical that changes the body\'s natural chemical balance in order to treat a medical condition.
