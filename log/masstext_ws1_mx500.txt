Prompt: 'What is considered a high blood pressure reading?\n' 
Generated text: "It should be under 160/100.  I'm surprised you've never been tested.  It's normal for a doctor to do this when you're young and healthy.  But if you have a family history or are above a certain age, it is suggested you get it tested more often."

Prompt: 'What are the risks of having high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe risk of heart disease is 2 to 6 times greater if you have high blood pressure, compared to people with normal blood pressure.\n\nHigh blood pressure is usually caused by an imbalance in the amount of salt in the blood (sodium). When the kidneys excrete salt, some of it stays in the body to act as a buffer against the loss of sodium and fluids (water) from the body. If this buffer is depleted, it can cause high blood pressure.\n\nWhat causes high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure is the result of a build up of pressure in the arteries and veins. This is caused by a number of factors. These include:\n\nFamily history\n\nAged 65 years and over\n\nObesity\n\nFasting glucose\n\nSmoking\n\nAlcohol consumption\n\nCardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality, especially in older people. The following are some risk factors for cardiovascular disease:\n\nFamily history\n\nAged 65 years and over\n\nObesity\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\nAged 45 years and over\n\nSmoking\n\nAlcohol consumption\n\nHigh blood pressure is usually inherited. However, some people develop high blood pressure from other risk factors, such as smoking.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\n\nSymptoms of high blood pressure can include:\n\nFrequent urination\n\nDizziness\n\nDry mouth\n\nNausea\n\nFatigue\n\nChest pain\n\nSudden dizziness or fainting\n\nSweating\n\nBreathlessness\n\nHeadaches\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nTiredness\n\nHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?\n\nHigh blood pressure is often diagnosed with a blood pressure reading.\n\nA blood pressure reading is done by taking the blood pressure of one or both arms (usually the left arm) while lying flat on your back. You may need to stand up, sit down, or use a stethoscope.\n\nThe following are the various methods that can be used to assess the blood pressure reading:\n\nAmmeter – A device that measures the force of the blood flowing through the artery. The force of the blood depends on the elasticity of the artery wall, the elasticity of the blood itself, and the pressure on the artery. A small gauge (smaller than 5mm) is used to measure the blood pressure.'

Prompt: 'What lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: "Here are some lifestyle changes you can make to help prevent high blood pressure:\n1. Eat less salt.\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends a maximum of 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day, or less than two teaspoons.\n2. Cut back on processed foods.\nThat includes hot dogs, soups, breakfast cereals, chips, crackers, and ready-to-eat foods.\n3. Get moving.\nTry to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.\n4. Do less stress.\nThat includes managing your workload and setting limits on how many hours you spend in front of the TV.\n5. Cut back on alcohol.\nHave no more than one drink a day for women and two for men.\n6. Quit smoking.\nIt's a proven fact that smoking increases the risk of high blood pressure."

Prompt: 'What kind of medicines can help control high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nSome common medicines to help control high blood pressure include diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, according to WebMD. Some of these drugs are combined with a diuretic in a pill called a diuretic-beta blocker combination pill, while others are combined with a calcium channel blocker in a pill called a calcium channel blocker-beta blocker combination pill.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nDiuretics reduce the amount of water in the body, causing it to lose sodium and become more concentrated, notes the Mayo Clinic. Beta-blockers reduce the heart rate, which allows the heart to work more efficiently and reduces the amount of oxygen the heart has to use. Calcium channel blockers help relax the blood vessels, allowing more blood to move through them, according to WebMD.'

Prompt: 'What are some things that can increase the risk of getting high blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe risk of getting high blood pressure can be increased through the consumption of junk food, smoking, not doing any physical activity, and being overweight, according to Mayo Clinic. These factors can also increase the risk of developing heart disease.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nConsuming excess salt and fat can lead to high blood pressure, according to Mayo Clinic. A high-fat diet can also increase the risk of developing diabetes, which increases the risk of high blood pressure, according to Mayo Clinic. Smoking is another risk factor that can increase the risk of high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nBeing overweight can also increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, according to Mayo Clinic. In addition, not doing any physical activity can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, according to Mayo Clinic.'

But the physician will have to ask a few questions about your medical history and your joint pain condition in order to give you the right medication.\n\nThe doctor will probably have to decide whether to give you the steroid injection in your shoulder. This will depend on the type of joint pain you have. The steroid will help reduce the inflammation in the joint. In some cases, the joint may be torn. In this case, the doctor will have to make an incision and repair the tear. If this is the case, then you will have to follow the doctor's instructions and you will be given the medication.\n\nIn this instance, the doctor will have to give you the medication on a daily basis. The doctor will give you the medication in your usual way. The doctor will probably advise you to take the medication before you go to bed. In most cases, the doctor will prescribe you the medication in a liquid form.\n\nThe doctor will usually prescribe you a steroid injection in the form of a long-acting injection. This is because in many cases, the injection is given in the shoulder. You will have to take the medication for a period of 2-3 months. The medication will help reduce the inflammation in your shoulder. It will also help you return to a normal function.\n\nIn order to ensure that you do not have side effects, you will have to follow the doctor's instructions and take the medication regularly. You will also have to avoid alcohol. You will have to avoid alcohol because alcohol is one of the main causes of the side effects of the medication."

Generated text: '\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused by a brain-destroying protein called prion. Prion diseases are extremely rare and have no known cure.\n\nWhat causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?\n\nResearchers have long known that prions are the cause of CJD. What they didn’t know was how the proteins are formed.\n\nFor years scientists have known that the protein is misfolded. But they didn’t understand how the misfolding occurs.\n\nIn a new study, a team of researchers from the University of Cambridge in England and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, discovered that the prions they studied are the result of a “breakdown” of a single amino acid.\n\nThey also discovered that this amino acid, called glycine, was being rapidly broken down in the brains of patients with CJD.\n\nThe researchers believe the discovery could help them develop new treatments for the disease.\n\nWhat are prions?\n\nPrions are a group of protein misfolding diseases that cause the death of brain cells. The most well-known prion diseases are scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is commonly called “mad cow disease.”\n\n“Prion diseases are extremely rare, and have no known cure. They are caused by misfolding of normally harmless proteins, leading to the formation of a misfolded protein called a prion. This protein then infects other proteins, causing them to misfold and become a prion as well,” the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) explained.\n\nWhat is CJD?\n\nCJD, also known as “vCJD” or “prion disease,” is a prion disease. It can only be caused by a misfolded protein called a prion.\n\n“When a person becomes infected with the CJD prion, the prion forms a structure called a prion protein. The prion protein then misfolds and forms insoluble aggregates (‘prion-like particles’) inside brain cells,” NINDS explained.\n\nThese prions are then transported to the brain stem and spinal cord, where they begin to destroy'

Prompt: 'What are the types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nIn Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, amyloid deposits form in the brain and spinal cord, and it is characterized by symptoms such as dementia, muscle weakness, abnormal behaviour and abnormal mental status.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, which means it is caused by a mutation in a gene. People inherit two copies of the gene from each parent, and each one of these copies can contain one or two mutations.\n\nPeople with one mutated copy of the gene, which is inherited from their father, are at risk of developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The risk of developing this condition is greater if the mutated copy is inherited from the mother because a child inherits two copies of the gene from both parents.\n\nPeople with two mutated copies of the gene are considered to have two separate types of the disease. The two types are sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a sporadic form of the disease, and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a family form of the disease.\n\nThe two types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are considered to be quite different because the symptoms of the two types vary. For example, people with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually develop signs of dementia and mental decline after the age of 50. This is not the case with people with the familial form of the disease, who develop signs of the disease early in life.'

There are several treatments that have been tried with some success. The treatments are used to stop the growth of the brain cells that die as a result of the disease.\n\nIt is important to seek medical help as soon as you suspect you may have CJD. Treatment may prolong the time before the first symptoms appear. Treatment can slow the progression of CJD, but it cannot stop it.\n\nThe following is an overview of the treatment options:\n\nMedications\n\nThere are several medications that are used to treat CJD. The following medications are sometimes used as first-line treatments:\n\nAzathioprine (Imuran)\n\nLemtrada (lemuradrine)\n\nRituximab\n\nThe drugs are given by mouth or intravenously. They have been shown to be effective for stopping the growth of brain cells in people who have been diagnosed with early-onset CJD.\n\nSurgery\n\nSurgery is sometimes used to remove affected tissue. The following surgical options are available:\n\nExtirpation\n\nThis procedure involves removing the entire diseased brain and spinal cord. The procedure is very difficult to do, and it is rarely done.\n\nVitrectomy\n\nThis procedure removes the vitreous, the gel-like material that fills the back of the eye.

Two years later, the company Genentech received approval from the European Commission for the same indication.\nHowever, in May 2011, FDA withdrew approval for the drug in the US, as the agency found that the drug didn't work in a clinical trial. The European approval was subsequently withdrawn in 2012.\nBy then, GSK had acquired the rights to vorinostat. The company then filed an application with the FDA to modify the design of the original trial. The agency accepted the application and the company received a complete response letter (CRL) in April 2015.\nThe company appealed against the rejection and the matter went to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In August 2016, the court ruled in favor of GSK, clearing the way for the approval of vorinostat.\nThe decision was welcomed by the company, but it came with a warning - the FDA could withdraw approval for vorinostat at any time.\nIn June 2017, the FDA approved the drug for the treatment of CLL and SLL.\nThe FDA approval of the drug was based on data from the original trial, which was modified. But GSK was required to provide additional information from a long-running phase II trial in China and an additional phase III trial in the US.\nIn November 2017, the company received approval in China for vorinostat as an add-on treatment to Rituximab for CLL and SLL patients who have failed to respond to Rituximab.\nVorinostat has been approved in Japan and the company has secured regulatory approvals in a number of other countries.\nIn September 2019, GSK announced that it would increase the number of patients enrolled in the phase III trial for vorinostat. The company said that it would increase the enrollment target to 570 patients to support potential approval in the US, as well as to support the filing of an application with the European Commission.\nWhy the variant CJD compensation scheme?\nThere are currently four ongoing phase III trials for vorinostat - the one in the US, the one in China, the one in Europe and the one in Japan."

Infections, including cold and flu, can be a cause of laryngitis, and so can allergies and irritations. Viral infections, such as the common cold, can cause swelling and irritation in the throat, resulting in laryngitis.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nInfluenza, or the common cold, is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the throat and the larynx. The virus enters the body through the nose and then makes its way to the throat and larynx, causing sore throat and sneezing. Laryngitis can also be caused by allergies. Common allergies include seasonal allergies, hay fever and pet dander. Inhaling allergens through the nose causes irritation to the throat and the larynx, which can cause laryngitis.\n\nOther causes of laryngitis include a vocal cord infection, a condition called oropharyngeal candidiasis and bacterial infection. Infections of the larynx can cause swelling in the throat, and a vocal cord infection can cause a sore throat and sore larynx. Bacterial infections, such as tonsillitis and laryngitis, are caused by bacteria that enter the body through the throat and the larynx.

Generated text: "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that can cause numbness, pain, vision problems and fatigue, among other symptoms.\nThe disease is so complex that it's often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. However, doctors have narrowed it down to some of the most common theories.\nA new study suggests that a mix of genetic, environmental and viral factors are to blame.\nThe new study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, revealed that the MS genes of people with the disease are more likely to be mutated.\nResearchers also discovered that the genes of the people who have the disease are more likely to interact with other genes in the body.\nThis combination is known as a genetic network.\nThe researchers found that the MS genes were associated with both 'positive' and 'negative' interactions.\n'Positive' interactions mean that the gene affects the body in a positive way - in other words, it helps the body function.\n'Negative' interactions mean that the gene affects the body in a negative way - for example, it causes a disease.\nA new study has revealed that the MS genes of people with the disease are more likely to be mutated. This combination is known as a genetic network. A stock image is pictured\nAnother key discovery was that MS genes are more likely to be mutated in people who have the disease.\nThis is in contrast to studies where researchers found that the genes of people without the disease were more likely to be mutated.\nThese differences were explained by the researchers, who said that the MS genes of people with the disease are 'extremely frequently mutated'.\n'This suggests that the MS genetic landscape is more complex than previously appreciated,' said the researchers.\nHowever, the researchers were unable to determine which exact MS gene is mutated in people with the disease.\nA study from last year revealed that a toxic protein found in the brain is a major factor in MS.\nThe protein, called C1q, affects the growth of blood vessels and is linked to MS.\nAdditionally, other studies have pointed to the existence of a virus called 'Listeria monocytogenes' in MS patients.\nThe virus - which was first discovered in the 19th century - can cause inflammation and can also trigger MS.\nThe immune system's natural defence system, called T cells, is also thought to be involved in MS.\nThe discovery that a toxic protein found in the brain is a major factor in MS could lead to new"

Prompt: 'What treatments are available for multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: "There are various treatment options available for multiple sclerosis, with many MS drugs either approved or being trialled for treating the condition.\nIn the UK, there are three treatments approved for use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), for people with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), such as Biogen's Tysabri.\nBiogen's Tysabri (natalizumab) was the first approved drug for the condition (PA)\nOther options for people with RRMS include Novartis's Gilenya, Roche's Ocrevus and Novo Nordisk's Tresiba.\nIn the US, more than 25 MS drugs are approved, with Biogen's Tysabri, Novartis's Gilenya and Biogen's Tecfidera the only three approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nA number of other drugs are currently being assessed by the FDA and other regulators worldwide.\nA number of drugs are currently being assessed by the FDA (PA)\nWhat is MS?\nMS is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) around nerve fibres, damaging them.\nThis disrupts the signals transmitted between the brain and body and can cause symptoms ranging from vision problems to weakness, numbness and pain.\nThe condition is more common in young women and men and is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50.\nAround 110,000 people in the UK have the condition, with around 2,000 new cases diagnosed each year.\nWho gets MS?\nThe causes of MS are not fully understood, although there is some evidence that there is a genetic link, while environmental factors and risk factors for developing the condition are unknown.\nA number of risk factors have been identified, including the age of onset and a family history of MS.\nSymptoms of MS can vary, depending on the location of the damage to the myelin sheath around nerve fibres.\nThe condition is more common in young women and men and is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 (PA)\nPeople with MS often experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, numbness or tingling, pain and cognitive issues, including memory loss.\nWhile there is no cure for MS, treatment can help control symptoms and reduce the impact the condition has on the body and mind.\nMS drugs\nMS drugs,"

Prompt: 'What is the outlook for people with multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: "\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe outlook for people with multiple sclerosis is good, according to Dr. Susan H. Haig, a neurologist at the Medical College of Georgia. People with multiple sclerosis may develop complications such as pneumonia, stroke or Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nPeople with multiple sclerosis have a 30 percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetime, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. MS is the most common neurological disease in young adults in the United States. Symptoms typically appear in the 20s and 30s, but in rare cases, symptoms appear in adolescence or adulthood.\n\nA person's risk of developing MS increases if a family member has the condition, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Smoking and obesity are associated with a higher risk of developing MS. Certain types of infections, smoking, head injuries and viral infections are also associated with an increased risk of MS.\n\nAccording to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, MS can be treated effectively if symptoms are caught early. Symptoms may include visual problems, fatigue and bladder problems. Treatment usually focuses on decreasing muscle weakness, improving mobility and controlling symptoms. Medications may be prescribed to treat vision problems and pain.\n\nTreatment for MS is not curative, but it may slow the progression of the disease and improve quality of life. The most common treatment is a drug called interferon, which attacks the immune system and may slow the progression of the disease. Other medications may be prescribed to treat vision problems, bladder problems, pain and other symptoms.\n\nMultiple sclerosis can also be treated with immunosuppressive medications, which suppress the immune system to help prevent the disease from worsening, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nA combination of therapies is the most effective treatment for people with relapsing remitting MS. People who are new to MS treatment should start with the lowest dose possible. Multiple sclerosis treatments typically last for several years."

If it does, then it's probably safe to use it for longer. If it doesn't, then it's probably not a good idea to use it for a longer period of time. The problem is that you probably don't know if you have bronchitis or something else because you haven't seen the doctor.

Prompt: 'What are the side effects of using steroids?\n' 
Generated text: "\nAll steroids carry some degree of side effects. In general, steroids cause more side effects than other medications because they are generally used for short periods of time and for a specific purpose. Side effects of steroids are due to their nature as steroids and are not due to the particular medication.\n\nThere are a few common side effects of using steroids:\n\nDryness of the skin:\n\nThis is due to the decrease of the skin's oil production. This is a common side effect of many topical medications, and can usually be treated with moisturizers.\n\nJoint pain:\n\nIn general, steroids cause joint pain. This is due to the increase in the joint fluid and the pain associated with this. Steroids are not recommended for long-term treatment of joint pain.\n\nWeight gain:\n\nSteroids cause weight gain. This weight gain is due to the body's increased need for energy to produce and maintain all of the body's functions. Most people lose their weight within a month of stopping the medication.\n\nFatigue:\n\nThis is due to the adrenal glands increasing production of adrenalin. This is a common side effect of many medications, including steroids.\n\nNausea:\n\nThis is due to the adrenal glands producing an excess of adrenaline. Symptoms can include stomach upset and vomiting.\n\nIncreased sweating:\n\nThis is due to the adrenal glands producing an excess of adrenaline. Symptoms can include sweating, hot flashes, and chills.\n\nOsteoporosis:\n\nSteroids do not increase the risk of osteoporosis.

While anabolic steroids are used for bodybuilding, to increase strength, and to help treat certain cancers.\n\nCorticosteroids are small, synthetic hormones that are used to treat a variety of health conditions. Anabolic steroids, on the other hand, are synthetic hormones that are used to increase strength and muscle mass.\n\nCorticosteroids are naturally occurring hormones that are produced by the body. These hormones are released in response to an allergic or inflammatory response and help to prevent or treat the symptoms. Corticosteroids are used to treat conditions such as:\n\nHives\n\nSevere skin reactions\n\nUrticaria\n\nSkin rash\n\nAsthma\n\nCough\n\nUpset stomach\n\nJoint and muscle pain\n\nBone and joint problems\n\nChronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis\n\nBecause corticosteroids are natural substances, they are safe to take.

Prompt: 'How do steroids work to reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune conditions?\n' 
Generated text: 'How do steroids work?\nSteroids are powerful anti-inflammatories that have been used for decades to treat symptoms of autoimmune diseases and other conditions such as asthma and arthritis.\nAdvertisement\nThe body uses inflammation to fight off infection but it can also cause harm to the body and joints if it\'s over-activated. Steroids are an effective way to reduce inflammation and also reduce the body\'s immune response to infections, which can help treat autoimmune conditions.\nAn autoimmune condition is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmune diseases are common and can have a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain, swelling, and fever.\n"Steroids are immunosuppressants, meaning they help reduce the immune system\'s overactive response to an infection. This is helpful in people with autoimmune diseases, who often have an overactive immune system that\'s causing disease," explains Dr Annette K. Orr, a rheumatologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Professor of Medicine at Ohio State University.\nHow do steroids work on the body?\nSteroids are immunosuppressants, meaning they help reduce the immune system\'s overactive response to an infection. This is helpful in people with autoimmune diseases, who often have an overactive immune system that\'s causing disease. Steroids are also used for other conditions such as asthma and arthritis, where inflammation can be troublesome.\nSteroids are effective at reducing inflammation, but they do not cure autoimmune diseases. Steroids suppress the immune system and it takes time for the body to fully recover from the effects of steroids.\n"Steroids are an effective way to treat people with autoimmune conditions, but steroids can only be used for so long before the immune system becomes resistant to them and needs to be treated with a different medication," explains Dr Orr.\nHow do steroids work for autoimmune diseases?\nOne of the ways steroids work is by preventing the body from producing inflammation-causing cytokines. Cytokines are proteins made by the immune system that can cause inflammation.\nIn people with autoimmune diseases, the immune system is overactive. This overactivity is caused by the body\'s own immune cells attacking the body.\nWhen the body responds to an infection by releasing inflammation-causing cytokines, it can cause long-term damage to the body.\nSteroids can reduce the body\'s immune response, which helps'

Prompt: 'What are the different types of steroids and how are they administered?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe primary goal of steroid administration is to improve the body’s response to acute or chronic injury or illness. These treatments are typically administered via injection or oral administration, though there are other ways of delivering these drugs.\n\nThe most common oral steroid treatment is prednisone. The most common injection type is a hydrocortisone product.\n\nHydrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid that is most commonly prescribed for conditions that involve inflammation.\n\nInjections are most commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and the flu. Oral steroids are most commonly used to treat conditions such as cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, lupus, and asthma.'

Generated text: '\nQuestion:\n\nWhat are the treatments for bronchitis?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the air passages that allow air to pass from the lungs to the outside. The bronchial tubes branch off from the trachea, which is the main air passage in the chest.\n\nTreatments for bronchitis include:\n\nover-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil)\n\nthe use of a nebulizer (a machine that turns liquid medicines into a mist that is inhaled)\n\nIf these treatments do not work, bronchitis can be treated with antibiotics. It can also be treated with steroids.\n\nBronchitis caused by colds or flu is usually not treated with antibiotics, but with OTC medications. Antibiotics are not usually recommended for bronchitis caused by viruses.\n\nSteroids are also used to treat bronchitis.\n\nIf your bronchitis does not get better, it may be caused by a serious condition called chronic bronchitis. This condition usually gets better on its own, but you should see your doctor if it does not.\n\nThis content is reviewed regularly and is updated when new and relevant evidence is made available.

Prompt: 'How is high blood pressure diagnosed and what is considered the ideal blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: "There are many ways to diagnose high blood pressure. Doctors use different blood tests to determine if high blood pressure is the reason behind an individual's symptoms. Other indicators, such as a large number of aortic stenosis or a history of heart disease, can be used to establish if the patient has high blood pressure.\nWhile doctors will use an individual's blood pressure to gauge the health of their heart and blood vessels, it is not always considered the most important number to keep track of. That's because blood pressure does not mean the same thing for everyone. A high blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean a patient is at risk for a heart attack or stroke, and a low blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean someone is at a lower risk.\nThe ideal blood pressure is calculated by a patient's age, weight, height, and gender. Doctors typically use the systolic blood pressure to assess the health of the heart, while the diastolic blood pressure indicates the health of the heart's arteries.\nWhat is the systolic blood pressure?\nThe systolic blood pressure is the amount of pressure exerted on the heart muscle. It is the value that is shown in a person's blood pressure reading.\nA blood pressure reading of 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is considered normal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It's also known as a diastolic blood pressure.\nFor example, a person with a systolic blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg has a normal blood pressure.

Generated text: "\nThe answer is: all kinds. High blood pressure is treated with a variety of drugs that target the blood vessel walls.\n\nBut it's important to understand that blood pressure isn't really a single disease. There are many different forms of it and these are treated differently.\n\nSome blood pressure medications are used to control the normal increase in blood pressure that occurs when we stand up. Others are used to treat the symptoms of high blood pressure. And some are used to prevent problems from happening in the future.\n\nMany medications are used to treat high blood pressure. What are the most common?\n\nHigh blood pressure is treated with a variety of different drugs. The most common are diuretics (water pills) and beta-blockers.\n\nBeta-blockers are used to prevent the abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. They also slow the heart rate and help keep it from beating too fast.\n\nBlood pressure is checked to monitor how well the heart pumps blood through the blood vessels. The reading is called systolic blood pressure (SBP). It's the pressure at which the heart pumps blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\n\nBlood pressure is measured by a blood pressure cuff. The cuff is wrapped around the upper arm, and the artery that supplies blood to the heart is inflated. Then the cuff is squeezed.\n\nThe increased pressure pushes against the artery walls. This causes the arteries to widen, which increases the blood flow out of the heart. The increased blood flow through the artery increases the pressure in the cuff.\n\nThe increased pressure in the cuff is translated into a number that is called the systolic blood pressure. It's the number you hear read on your blood pressure machine.\n\nThere are two types of blood pressure. The first is called diastolic blood pressure (DBP). It's the number you hear read on your blood pressure machine. It's the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest.\n\nWhen a person is standing up, the diastolic pressure is the lowest. When a person is lying down, it's the highest.\n\nBlood pressure is measured by a blood pressure cuff.

To find out if you have high blood pressure, your doctor will take a complete medical history and examine you for any unusual symptoms.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nYour doctor will perform a blood pressure test, also called a blood pressure reading, to determine your blood pressure. The blood pressure test uses a cuff that is attached to an arm or leg and inflated to determine your blood pressure. The cuff then is inflated to a specific level for a certain amount of time, usually five minutes. After the cuff is deflated, the pressure is recorded and compared to a healthy blood pressure.\n\nYour doctor may also perform other tests, such as blood work or an echocardiogram, to determine if you have high blood pressure. The diagnosis may require that your doctor check your blood pressure several times over the course of several days or weeks.'

Prompt: 'What are the benefits of reducing blood pressure?\n' 
Generated text: '\nDoctors say that high blood pressure contributes to the risk of heart disease, strokes, kidney failure, and other serious medical conditions. The primary goal of treatment for high blood pressure is to reduce the force of the blood against the walls of the arteries, preventing the hardening of the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease, and preventing blood from leaking into the spaces between the heart and the lungs. Treatment options for high blood pressure include lifestyle changes, blood pressure medications, and when necessary, a combination of both.\n\nLifestyle changes\n\nLifestyle changes are a primary way of lowering blood pressure. Health professionals encourage individuals to make changes to their diet, regular exercise, and weight. They also encourage individuals to drink enough water, limit alcohol, and avoid smoking. In addition, health professionals encourage individuals to follow a healthy sleep schedule. People who have high blood pressure should avoid sleeping for 12 hours or more a day.\n\nBlood pressure medications\n\nDoctors may prescribe blood pressure medications to individuals with high blood pressure.

Generated text: '\nBronchitis is inflammation of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs. The tubes are called the bronchi. Bronchitis can happen to anyone, but it is more common in children and the elderly. When the inflammation and irritation of the bronchi continues, it is called chronic bronchitis.\n\nThe inflammation of the bronchi may be caused by a viral infection or an infection that is in your lungs. It can be caused by smoking, inhaling second-hand smoke, inhaling particles from dust or mold, or pollutants in the air.\n\nAn infected bronchus can cause white spots on your chest that are called bronchioles. Bronchioles are the small tubes that carry air from the lungs to the outside. When the bronchi get inflamed, they can become swollen and irritated.\n\nBronchitis can happen at any age, but it is more common in children than adults. One reason is that children are more likely to play in areas where others are playing, and more likely to play with toys that come in contact with other people. A viral infection is usually the cause of bronchitis in children.\n\nAdults are more likely to have an infection of their lungs. It is also more likely to be a chronic infection that has not gone away. This type of infection can be caused by smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke.\n\nBronchitis can also occur in adults that have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard for people to breathe. It is very common in older adults.

Prompt: 'What are the symptoms of CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nCJD can develop in two ways: 1) from a "sporadic" person, meaning that the person has no family history of the disease and has no known exposure to the prion, or 2) from a person with an inherited predisposition to CJD.\n\nTransmission of CJD can occur from person to person, but only through blood transfusions and organ transplants.\n\nWhat is prion disease?\n\nPrion disease is a neurological disease that affects the brain and is characterized by the misfolding of protein. The protein is called "prion" because it looks like an "S." The misfolding of the protein creates misfolded proteins in the brain. These misfolded proteins can clump together to form what is called a "prion." A prion is not like normal protein, it is infectious and can be transmitted from person to person.\n\nCJD is caused by a prion protein that is misfolded in the brain. When a person develops CJD, the disease affects the brain and spinal cord. CJD can affect any part of the brain, but the most common location is the back of the brain, or in the cerebellum. In the brain, CJD can affect any part of the brain, but the most common location is the back of the brain, or in the cerebellum.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of CJD?\n\nCJD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms get worse over time. The symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. The symptoms of CJD are different from each other and may be mild, moderate, or severe.\n\nHow do you know if you have CJD?\n\nYou can test your blood for prions and blood transfusions and organ transplants for CJD.'

Prompt: 'What causes CJD?\n' 
Generated text: "\nThe causes of CJD are not fully understood. In the 1950s, CJD was called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In 1976, the name changed to Parkinson's disease.\n\nCJD is caused by the rare, genetic disorder, prion disease. CJD is a fatal, degenerative brain disease that affects all parts of the brain. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but there are cases of CJD with an X-linked pattern.\n\nThe most common form of CJD is the sporadic or sporadic type, which affects about one in a million people.\n\nCJD is not contagious. If the body makes proteins that are normal in the body, there is little risk of developing CJD.\n\nThe most common risk factors for CJD include:\n\nIntake of contaminated tissue, such as prions that have entered the blood stream.\n\nSitting or lying in the same position for long periods of time.\n\nBeing exposed to contaminated blood or other body fluids.\n\nExposure to infected food or animal products.\n\nA family history of CJD, or another neurological disease.\n\nCJD is also caused by the following:\n\nCJD caused by inherited mutations that have not yet been identified.\n\nCJD caused by in-vitro transmission of normal prions from one animal to another, which is called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).\n\nTreatment\n\nThe main treatment is supportive care. This includes watching the person carefully for signs of deterioration, and the gradual replacement of lost fluids and nutrition.\n\nThe prognosis depends on the age at which the person is diagnosed, the number of people in the family with CJD, and the extent of the symptoms.\n\nIn the United States, there are no approved treatments for CJD. The treatments that are currently available to control the symptoms of CJD may be helpful for reducing the risk of developing the disease, but they do not treat the disease."

Prompt: 'How is sporadic CJD caused?\n' 
Generated text: '\nWhat is the mechanism of sporadic CJD?\n\nWhy are people at risk of sporadic CJD?\n\nCan CJD be prevented?\n\nHow is sporadic CJD diagnosed?\n\nHow is sporadic CJD treated?\n\nWhat is the prognosis for sporadic CJD?\n\nDo I have a risk of CJD?\n\nIntroduction\n\nChronic, progressive and often fatal, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease. It is caused by spontaneous mutations in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes for the prion protein (PrP). PrP is an essential component of the normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex, which is involved in the formation of prion proteins.\n\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) estimates that sporadic CJD affects approximately one in a million people worldwide. In the United States, there are an estimated 5 sporadic CJD cases per year.\n\nCJD is an inherited disorder.\n\nThe main risk factors for sporadic CJD are older age, male gender and a family history of CJD.\n\nHow is CJD caused?\n\nCJD is caused by the spontaneous mutations in a gene on chromosome 19 that encodes for the prion protein. Prion proteins are normally a part of the normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex. PrPSc is involved in the formation of prion proteins. The normal prion protein (PrPSc) complex is normal and is not affected by the mutation. The prion protein (PrP) is the infectious form of a protein that is normally found in the brain of healthy people. The infectious prion protein (PrPSc) is the cause of the disease.\n\nHow is CJD diagnosed?\n\nThe first clinical diagnosis of CJD is usually made during autopsy when the individual has died. During autopsy, the presence of PrPSc in the brain is detected and the cause of death is determined. However, the diagnosis of CJD can be made with the help of a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a living individual.\n\nWhat is the prognosis for CJD?\n\nCJD is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. This means that symptoms appear slowly, and the symptoms may not be apparent for many years.'

Generated text: 'New/different variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.'

Prompt: 'What is familial or inherited CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nCJD is a condition in which proteins from the brain’s nerve cells called neurons break down and leak into the blood. The proteins that leak can cause an abnormal accumulation of the protein prion in the brain.\n\nThe abnormal prion protein is then transmitted to other cells in the body, and can cause damage to those cells.\n\nCJD is rare. In the United States, about one in every one million people will develop CJD. There are no vaccines or treatments for CJD.\n\nHow is CJD inherited?\n\nCJD is usually inherited from a parent. The risk of developing CJD increases with the number of close relatives — a parent and child or a parent and sibling — who have had CJD.\n\nHow common is CJD in the U.S.?\n\nIt is rare. Between 1980 and 2015, there have been about 13 reported cases of CJD in the United States.\n\nHow can you tell if your loved one has CJD?\n\nCJD is an inherited disorder. It is not passed from person to person, so your loved one may have CJD without knowing it.\n\nWhat symptoms should I look for?\n\nSymptoms may appear years after the person first develops the condition. In many cases, symptoms don’t appear until later in life. In the U.S., most cases of CJD are diagnosed before age 60.\n\nCJD in a child\n\nSymptoms usually appear between the ages of 5 and 12 years.\n\nCJD in teens\n\nMost cases of CJD begin in teens or young adults.\n\nCJD in children and adults\n\nCJD is rare in children and adults.\n\nCJD in teens\n\nCJD usually does not cause symptoms until teens or young adults. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 15 and 30 years.\n\nCJD in adults\n\nMost cases of CJD begin in adults.\n\nCJD in children and adults\n\nCJD is rare in children and adults.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect a loved one has CJD?\n\nTalk with your healthcare provider about any symptoms you or your loved one has had, or any problems you have noticed in your loved one.\n\nIf you have a child who has symptoms of CJD, contact the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (P-CURU) at the University of California'

Prompt: 'What is iatrogenic CJD?\n' 
Generated text: '\nIatrogenic CJD (iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a rare, fatal, human disease caused by a human retrovirus (human endogenous retrovirus, HERV). Iatrogenic CJD occurs when a person is given the retroviral immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to protect against a different disease (such as an infection). Such therapy was once common. Over the last decade, however, few people receive these antibodies.\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD is a rare variant, in which the iatrogenic antibodies cross the blood–brain barrier and cause damage to the brain. There is no evidence that the iatrogenic form of CJD is caused by any other human retrovirus. The main risk factors for iatrogenic CJD are the use of recombinant human insulin (human insulin gene transfer) for diabetes, and the use of human insulin or human insulin gene transfer for any other disease.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD can cause any of the following symptoms:\n\nA slight loss of balance or gait may be present\n\nLoss of muscle coordination, balance, or coordination of facial expression may be present\n\nA very slight loss of muscle tone and rigidity of limbs may be present.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of bladder control.\n\nThere may be a slight loss of coordination of facial expression.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe iatrogenic form of CJD is a rapidly progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Death usually occurs within 1 to 3 years of diagnosis. In people who die of iatrogenic CJD, the following may be the cause:\n\nInability to eat or swallow, leading to malnutrition\n\nSevere brain damage\n\nAbsence of the part of the brain that controls movement\n\nHow to avoid or minimize iatrogenic CJD\n\nYou can reduce your risk of iatrogenic CJD by not receiving any human retrovirus immunoglobulin therapy, especially those that cross the blood–brain barrier. Treatment with human insulin is much less likely to cause iatrogenic CJD than treatment with human insulin gene transfer.\n\nFor information about HIV, AIDS, and other STD/HIV prevention topics,'

Prompt: 'What is the incubation period for variant CJD?\n' 
Generated text: "\nCJD is a transmissible disease caused by a variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) variant called amyloid-beta (Aβ).\n\nIt is caused by a protein found in the amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of people with the disease. These plaques are formed when the body makes too much of a protein called amyloid-β.\n\nHowever, unlike Alzheimer's disease, people with CJD develop a slow, progressive form of the disease, and the symptoms start in their 40s.\n\nIn people with CJD, the disease is almost always caused by infection with the prion protein variant, or the mutation (called the prion-related transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or prion-TSE).\n\nIn people without the variant prion protein, prion disease does not occur.\n\nCJD incubation period\n\nThere is no known way to diagnose the disease in a person before it starts.\n\nSymptoms of CJD usually appear years after an infectious infection with the prion protein.\n\nIt is known that CJD can be caused by a number of different viruses and bacteria, but the incubation period for these infections is usually longer than 10 years.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that these infections can't cause CJD. In rare cases, the virus or bacteria that cause CJD can enter the brain before the plaques appear. This is called a ‘spontaneous CJD’.\n\nSome research suggests that this may be true for many prion diseases, including CJD.\n\nIn spontaneous CJD, the infection causes an abnormal form of the prion protein to form.

Prompt: 'What causes a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nShare this page\n\nHeart attacks are caused when blood flow to the heart is reduced or blocked. A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart is stopped. This can be caused by a heart attack, a condition that causes blood to not reach the heart, or a problem that causes blood to not flow from the heart to the rest of the body.\n\nCauses of heart attack\n\nSome causes of a heart attack are due to other health conditions. Some heart attack symptoms are similar to those caused by certain other medical conditions. It is important to consult a doctor or visit your family doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms.\n\nHeart attack symptoms\n\nHeart attack symptoms include:\n\nChest pain\n\nUncomfortable or tight pressure or squeezing in the chest\n\nPain that spreads to the left arm, shoulder or back\n\nShortness of breath\n\nPain or discomfort in the neck, jaw, upper back or stomach\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nDizziness or light-headedness\n\nFatigue\n\nSweating\n\nSweating may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment for heart attack\n\nA medical professional will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. The doctor will conduct a physical examination, to check for a range of conditions that can cause chest pain. The doctor may also ask you questions about your general health and lifestyle habits.\n\nA doctor may perform several tests to diagnose heart attack.

Prompt: 'What are the complications of a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the most common complication of a heart attack is permanent heart damage. A heart attack can lead to heart failure, which means that the heart muscle can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of the body, and it can also cause angina, or chest pain. Other common complications include a heart attack-related disability, congestive heart failure and heart attack-related death.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nHeart attacks can be serious, even if they do not cause death. A heart attack can be a life-threatening condition, and it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible. The Mayo Clinic advises that signs of a heart attack include pain or discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes, discomfort in one or both arms, back or jaw, shortness of breath or coughing up blood. The Mayo Clinic also notes that people with chest pain may have other symptoms, such as nausea, lightheadedness, sweating, indigestion or back pain.\n\nThe most effective treatment for heart attacks is to open up the coronary artery and restore blood flow. Treatment options include angioplasty and stenting, and the American Heart Association notes that these procedures are highly effective for treating heart attacks. The Mayo Clinic notes that stents can be placed in the coronary artery to reinforce or widen the artery.\n\nOther treatment options include medications, such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. The Mayo Clinic notes that beta blockers may be recommended for people who have heart failure. Other options include the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which are also available in combination with a calcium channel blocker.'

Prompt: 'How long does it take to recover from a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nRecovery from a heart attack can take as little as six weeks or as long as six months. The time it takes to recover depends on the severity of the attack and the age and health of the person affected. In general, a heart attack that results in death typically takes longer to recover from than an attack that does not result in death.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nRecovery from a heart attack can take longer if there was a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The person will need to have bypass surgery to clear the blockage. If a blockage is not found, recovery time can be significantly less than six weeks. In a heart attack that causes a minor injury to the heart muscle, recovery time can be up to six months, depending on how severe the damage is.\n\nA person who experiences a heart attack may need to take medication and may experience fatigue and weakness. They may also experience shortness of breath and may not be able to exert themselves as much. It is important that a person who has had a heart attack and is currently experiencing shortness of breath contact their doctor immediately. If a heart attack was caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries, the doctor may recommend a stress test or an angiogram.'

Prompt: 'What is the outlook for someone who has experienced a heart attack?\n' 
Generated text: '\nThe outlook is very good if you’re being treated by a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon who are members of the Heart & Vascular Center. These physicians are expert at treating heart attacks, heart conditions, and strokes.\n\nMost heart attacks occur in the left ventricle, which is located on the top of the heart. The lining of the heart is made up of many tiny blood vessels. The heart muscle is lined with a soft connective tissue called myocardium.\n\nWhen a heart attack occurs, the blood supply to the left side of the heart is blocked. The heart muscle is starved of oxygen-rich blood and begins to die. If the blockage is severe, the heart muscle can die, and if the blockage is not severe, the heart muscle can grow weaker.\n\nThe heart muscle can be healed by surgery, but in most cases, the heart will have to be replaced with a mechanical heart.\n\nMany heart attacks are caused by the build-up of fatty deposits known as plaque. These deposits can build up in the arteries, narrow the arteries, and form a blockage.\n\nPlaque builds up in the arteries when fat deposits build up on the arterial walls and block the flow of blood.\n\nThe good news is that the Heart & Vascular Center can help. The Heart & Vascular Center team of cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, and nurses is one of the best in the world at treating heart attacks.\n\nDuring a heart attack, blood flow to the heart is cut off by a blood clot. The heart is starved of oxygen-rich blood, and the heart muscle begins to die. This can be fatal.\n\nThe blockage in the artery can be opened by removing the blood clot, which is done by means of catheterization. The catheter is placed into the artery and directed to the blockage. A balloon is then inflated, causing the blood clot to break up and the blockage to be removed.\n\nSurgery can be used to reopen the artery. However, if the artery is very narrow, the artery may need to be replaced with a mechanical heart.\n\nThese procedures can be done at the same time, or they can be done separately. The Heart & Vascular Center offers a wide range of treatment options to ensure that patients receive the best possible care.\n\nFor more information about a heart attack, heart disease,'

Prompt: 'What are the different types of steroids?\n' 
Generated text: '\nA:\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThere are two main types of steroids: anabolic steroids and androgenic steroids. The first are the male hormone, and the second are the female hormone. Both have the same chemical structure, and the effects of the two are similar.\n\nKeep Learning\n\nAnabolic steroids are chemically defined as steroids that are produced in the pituitary gland of the human brain. These steroids have the ability to stimulate the production of protein, especially muscle protein. This increases the muscle mass and strength of the person. These steroids are produced by the human body to stimulate growth, especially during adolescence. This hormone is called testosterone.\n\nAnabolic steroids are also sometimes referred to as androgenic steroids because they stimulate the growth of the male sex organs. Anabolic steroids can also cause a person to lose weight because they suppress the appetite. The opposite can also occur, especially during the period of puberty. During this time, anabolic steroids can cause excess body fat to accumulate in the body.\n\nAnabolic steroids are also used to treat conditions such as osteoporosis and certain types of cancer. These steroid drugs can stimulate bone growth in the body, and they may also decrease the growth of tumors.\n\nOn the other hand, androgenic steroids are also produced by the pituitary gland. This hormone is also known as the female hormone. Androgenic steroids, like the male hormones, also stimulate the production of protein in the body. This can lead to the growth of the female sex organs, including breast tissue, but it also causes hair growth and facial hair growth.\n\nThese steroids are also often used to treat hormonal problems, such as pregnancy, menopause, and the female hormone-induced condition called gynecomastia. Because they stimulate the growth of the female sex organs, these drugs can cause unwanted side effects. Androgenic steroids also stimulate the growth of body hair. These drugs are also used to treat hormone-dependent cancers, but these drugs can have adverse effects on the heart.'

If you have any concerns, consult your doctor before you start taking them.\n\nWhat are the side effects of taking steroids?\n\nSide effects from taking steroids are mild and temporary. If you are taking a steroid for an infection, for example, your doctor may prescribe it in low doses for a few days. When the infection is gone, you can stop taking the steroid and your body will be able to get back to normal.\n\nBecause steroids can be used to treat a variety of conditions, they often have side effects that are specific to the individual.\n\nIn general, the most common side effects from taking steroids are:\n\nIncreased appetite\n\nSwelling of the face and hands\n\nCough\n\nAnxiety\n\nWeight gain\n\nYou may also experience the following side effects if you are taking a steroid:\n\nFatigue\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nIncreased blood sugar\n\nMuscle cramps\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nVomiting\n\nChanges in the levels of some types of hormones in your blood\n\nSoreness in your joints\n\nDizziness\n\nHeadaches\n\nChanges in your mood\n\nDecreased sensitivity to pain\n\nSore throat\n\nMouth sores\n\nEyes that burn\n\nChanges in skin color\n\nTrouble sleeping\n\nSore muscles\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of taking steroids?\n\nSome steroids can cause significant long-term side effects.

Prompt: 'What are anabolic steroids, and how are they different from corticosteroids?\n' 
Generated text: "They are steroids. They're different because they are more anabolic.\nAnabolic steroids are a class of pharmaceutical drugs that, when ingested in high doses, can increase muscle protein synthesis and the rate of protein breakdown, as well as reduce fat tissue and increase lean body mass in humans. Anabolic steroids are different from corticosteroids because they are the most anabolic of the three classes of drugs and have been the focus of steroid abuse in sports for decades.\nIn the wake of the recent Sports Illustrated cover story about the use of steroids in baseball, many are left wondering: What are anabolic steroids and why are they banned in sports?\nMost people are familiar with the use of corticosteroids (including prednisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisone) in treating a variety of autoimmune conditions and inflammatory disorders. They work by inhibiting the synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, while also inhibiting the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-9, and IL-15. Corticosteroids are often the first-line treatment for autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and lupus nephritis.\nWhile corticosteroids are effective in treating many autoimmune conditions, they can cause serious side effects in certain patients, including thinning of the hair, thinning of the skin, acne, and significant weight gain. While corticosteroids are also used as anti-inflammatory medications to treat such conditions as asthma and inflammation of the joints, they are also used to suppress inflammation in other places in the body, including the lungs and the heart.\nBecause corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation in the lungs, asthma can develop in certain patients. While corticosteroids are also sometimes used to treat inflammation in the heart, this treatment is used sparingly because it can cause an increase in the blood pressure and heart rate.\nAnabolic steroids, on the other hand, are a class of drugs that increase the production of proteins that help build muscle. Anabolic steroids, often called anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), can be taken orally in the form of pills or as an injection. The most commonly used anabolic steroid in sports is testosterone, which is often used to treat male-pattern baldness.\nWhile"

The virus attacks white blood cells, and can cause diseases such as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and lymphoma. Once it is in the bloodstream, it may spread to the nervous system, brain, liver and spleen.\n\nPeople who have AIDS have many illnesses due to the virus. Some of the most common symptoms are weight loss, fever, sores in the mouth and throat, stomach pain, and weakness. With HIV, there is a strong possibility that the immune system will begin to fail, and the person may have a high risk of developing tuberculosis, hepatitis, pneumonia, and cancer.\n\nHIV can be transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk and saliva. Transmission can occur if an infected person does not know that he or she is infected.\n\nHIV cannot be spread through casual contact. In order to transmit HIV, a person must have a break in their immune system. It is important to note that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. AIDS is caused by the body\'s immune system becoming weak and unable to fight off a wide variety of infections.\n\nPeople can be infected with HIV if they have sex with someone who is infected with the virus. This is known as "contact" transmission. The virus can also be transmitted if someone has sex with an infected mother and her child is born with HIV.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?\n\nSome of the first symptoms of HIV are flu-like, and include fever, chills, sore throat, and muscle aches.

Prompt: 'What is multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMultiple sclerosis is an illness that affects the nervous system. It’s a chronic condition that causes the brain and spinal cord to become damaged. This can lead to many different symptoms, which can include:\n\nNumbness\n\nTingling\n\nWeakness\n\nBlurred vision\n\nSlow movement\n\nProblems with balance\n\nFatigue\n\nBalance problems\n\nDizziness\n\nSpeech difficulties\n\nStroke-like episodes\n\nHeadaches\n\nIt’s often called the ‘brain’s immune system’ because it affects a part of the brain called the myelin sheath.\n\nThe myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, protecting them. When multiple sclerosis damages the myelin sheath, nerve cells can’t communicate as quickly and clearly as they used to. This can result in problems with movement and co-ordination.\n\nIn the early stages of MS, the myelin sheath is damaged and we don’t yet know why or how this happens. As the disease progresses, the myelin sheath is damaged more and more, and the symptoms can become more severe.\n\nMS is the most common chronic neurological condition in Australia, with around 300 new cases diagnosed each year.\n\nHow can I tell if I have MS?\n\nThe signs and symptoms of MS are similar to those of many other neurological diseases and conditions. If you’re concerned that you might have MS, the best thing to do is to see your doctor.\n\nA doctor may be able to do a physical examination to check for symptoms. For example, a doctor may feel the muscles in your arms and legs and check for any tingling or numbness.\n\nA doctor may also do a neurological examination to check for any signs or symptoms. These include:\n\nTingling, numbness or weakness in a part of your body. This may be in your arms, legs or hands.\n\nDifficulty moving some parts of your body. This may be due to weakness, tiredness or difficulty with coordination.\n\nTrouble walking or moving.\n\nPoor coordination or trouble with balance.\n\nBlurred or double vision.\n\nA slow or erratic heartbeat.\n\nHow can MS be treated?\n\nThere’s no cure for MS.\n\n'

Prompt: 'What causes multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and is caused by a previously unidentified autoimmune disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). It has three types of symptoms: relapsing, remitting, and progressive forms. Relapsing forms are the most common type and can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary relapsing forms of MS are initially diagnosed before a person reaches 40 years of age, while secondary relapsing forms are more common in older patients.\n\nThe majority of patients will have two or more relapses in their life time, which can range from one to five. A relapse is a temporary worsening of symptoms that occurs after a remission. There are two types of remitting forms of MS: primary and secondary. Primary remitting forms can be either primary or secondary. Secondary forms of MS are more likely to progress into secondary progressive forms of MS.\n\nThe progressive forms of MS are most common in women and people who are under age 40. The progressive forms of MS can cause gradual loss of cognitive function and can also lead to paralysis. The causes of progressive forms are unknown, although smoking, family history of multiple sclerosis, and exposure to environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation have been associated with the disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis can also develop as a result of spinal cord injury. It can also occur as a result of stroke or trauma.\n\nIf multiple sclerosis occurs in the brain, it is known as brain-specific MS (BSMS). If it occurs in the spinal cord, it is known as spinal cord-specific MS (SCMS). If both brain and spinal cord are affected, it is called mixed-type MS.\n\nMost of the time, multiple sclerosis is diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. The early stages of multiple sclerosis are associated with symptoms that are similar to those of multiple sclerosis.\n\nSymptoms of Multiple Sclerosis\n\nThere are many symptoms of multiple sclerosis that depend on which area of the brain is affected. The first signs of MS can include:\n\nWeakness\n\nTingling or numbness\n\nDizziness\n\nVertigo\n\nVisual disturbances\n\nVision loss\n\nConcentration difficulties'

Prompt: 'What treatments exist for multiple sclerosis?\n' 
Generated text: '\nMS is a chronic disease that attacks the nervous system in the brain and spinal cord. The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The disease affects the signals that travel along the nervous system.\n\nThe main treatments are drugs that slow the progression of the disease.\n\nOne drug called interferon beta (IFN-beta) is used for relapsing-remitting MS. It slows down the disease and lessens symptoms.\n\nIf the disease progresses, the drug is not effective. Another drug called glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is used to slow down the progression of the disease and reduce symptoms. Glatiramer acetate is injected into the body once every four weeks.\n\nIf the disease progresses, it is very hard to treat. The body’s immune system attacks the nerves. There are no good treatments that can help the nerves.\n\nHow is MS diagnosed?\n\nThe cause of MS is unknown.\n\nMS is diagnosed based on the symptoms. Most people with MS have at least one symptom. The most common symptoms are numbness or tingling in one or more parts of the body. They may also experience muscle spasms or tremors.\n\nThese symptoms can appear and disappear. There is no way to predict which symptoms will appear and when.\n\nThe symptoms depend on where the damage occurs in the nervous system.\n\nHow is MS treated?\n\nThere are no drugs that can help the nerves.

Generated text: '\nLes stéroïdes sont des hormones générées par la circulation sanguine, et produites par des cellules qui présentent des différences de shape et de forme. Dans un cas particulier, ils se produisent par la fibrose pulmonaire. L\'enjeu de la santé est donc de trouver des antidépresseurs contre ce type de fibrose pulmonaire.\n\nSelon le Dr Errol Flynn, le Dr George Pappas et le Dr Richard Cade, une association de médecins à l\'époque, "les stéroïdes sont des hormones qui provoquent la dépression et la fièvre, et peuvent conduire à des troubles psychiatriques. Cela dit, la réponse à cette évolution des sciences s\'est donc mise sur la dépression et la fièvre, et les stéroïdes comme antidépresseurs n\'ont pas été recherchés. Mais il a été démontré que, dans une situation de stress, les stéroïdes peuvent aussi contribuer à une augmentation du risque de dépression et de fièvre chez les personnes qui en ont besoin. Par exemple, ils augmentent le risque de dépression chez des patientes atteintes de fibrose pulmonaire."\n\nLe Dr Flynn, qui était un des personnages les plus connus de l\'émission "Hollywood Squares", a ajouté que "les gens qui ont développé une fibrose pulmonaire le savent déjà, mais nous ne savons pas pourquoi, et nous n\'avons pas d\'explication.

Generated text: "\nLes stéroïdes, soit les stéroïdes actifs, soit les stéroïdes inactivés, sont des molécules chimiques, identifiées par leur caractère de structure chimique. Les stéroïdes actifs sont classées en trois catégories (« A », « B » et « C »). La catégorie « A » comprend les stéroïdes produits par les océans, ceux produits par les plantes et ceux produits par les végétaux. Les stéroïdes « B » sont les stéroïdes qui se trouvent dans les plantes, et les stéroïdes « C » sont les stéroïdes qui se trouvent dans les végétaux. Les stéroïdes « A » sont les plus souvent utilisés pour traiter des maladies qui ont un impact sur la santé humaine. C'est notamment le cas pour la maladie de Parkinson et la maladie de dépression. La maladie de dépression, soit le syndrome du dépressionnisme, est une maladie qui affecte la dépression, une psychose ou une manque d'estime. C'est aussi le cas pour certaines maladies chroniques comme le cancer ou le syndrome de l'osteomédecine. Les stéroïdes « B » sont aussi utilisés pour traiter des maladies chroniques comme le cancer, le syndrome de l'osteomédecine, la maladie de la choréfaste et la maladie de la cardioselle.
